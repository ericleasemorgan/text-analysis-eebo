The invaluable price of an immortal soul shewing the vanity of most people in taking care for the body, but neglect their duty as to the preservation of their never-dying souls : with advice to secure sinners to examine themselves before it be too late, that when death shall come to separate their souls from their bodies, they may be in a condition to welcome death for that happy change which all prepared Christians will ever rejoyce in : very necessary for all people to read and consider who would willingly be accounted true Christians : with large admonition to prayer as a duty most incumbant upon all who desire to obtain everlasting life through Christ Jesus.
