Their Parents also kept them to a continual Employment, which did <span class="hi">more</span> than de­liver them from the Temptations of <span class="hi">Idleness,</span> and as young as they were, they took a delight in it; It may be <span class="hi">as much</span> as they should have done. In a word, Such was the whole <span class="hi">Temper</span> and <span class="hi">Car­rings</span> of the Children, that there cannot easily be any thing more unreasonable, than to i­magine that a <span class="hi">Design to Dissemble</span> could cause them to fall into any of their odd Fits; though there should not have happened, as there <span class="hi">did,</span> &amp; thousand Things, wherein it was perfectly im­possible for any <span class="hi">Dissimulation</span> of theirs to produce what scores of spectators were amazed at.</p><p>SECT.

Upon the Commitment of this <span class="hi">extraordinary Woman,</span> all the Children had some present ease; until one (related unto <span class="hi">her</span>) ac­cidentally meeting one or two of them, enter­tain'd them with her <span class="hi">Blessing,</span> that is, <span class="hi">Railing;</span> upon which <span class="hi">Three</span> of them fell il again, as they were before.</p><p>SECT. <span class="hi">VIII.</span> It was not long before the <span class="hi">Witch</span> thus in the Trap, was brought upon her <span class="hi">Tryal;</span> at which, thro' the Efficacy of a <span class="hi">Charm,</span> I suppose, used upon her, by <span class="hi">one</span> or <span class="hi">some</span> of her Crue, the Court could receive Answers from her in none but the <span class="hi">Irish,</span> which was her <span class="hi">Native</span> Language; altho she understood the <span class="hi">English</span> ve­ry well, and had accustomed her whole Family to none but <span class="hi">that</span> Language in her former Conversa­tion; and therefore the Communication be­tween the <span class="hi">Bench</span> and the <span class="hi">Bar,</span> was now cheefly convey'd by two honest and faithful men that were <span class="hi">Interpreters.</span> It was long before she could with any direct Answers plead unto her <span class="hi">Indict­ment;</span> and when she <span class="hi">did</span> plead, it was with <span class="hi">Con­fession,</span> rather than <span class="hi">Denial</span> of her Guilt.

When these were produced, the vile Woman acknowledged, that her way to torment the Objects of her malice, was by wes­ting of her <span class="hi">Finger</span> with her <span class="hi">Spittle,</span> and stroaking of those little <span class="hi">Images.</span> The abused Children were then <span class="unclear">present[?]</span>, and the Woman still kept stooping and shrinking as one that was almost prest to Death with a mighty Weight upon her. But one of the <span class="hi">Images</span> being brought unto her, immediately she started up after an odd manner, and took it into her hand; but she had no sooner taken <span class="hi">it,</span> than <span class="hi">one</span> of the Children fell into sad <span class="hi">Fits</span> before the <span class="hi">whole Assembly.</span> This the Judges had their just Apprehensions at; and careful­ly causing the Repetition of the Experiment, found again the same event of it.

They diverse times vvere very near <span class="hi">Burning</span> or <span class="hi">Drown­ing</span> of themselves, but the Children themselves by their ovvn pittiful and seasonable cries for Help, still procured their Deliverance: Which made me to Consider, Whether the <span class="hi">Little ones</span> had not <span class="hi">their Angels,</span> in the plain sense of Our Saviours Intimation.

But if any small Mischief happen'd to be done where they were; as the Tearing or Dirtying of a <span class="hi">Garment;</span> the Falling of a <span class="hi">Cup,</span> the breaking of a <span class="hi">Glass,</span> or the like; they would re­joice extremely, &amp; fall into a pleasure &amp; Laugh­ter very extraordinary. All which things com­par'd with the Temper of the Children, when they are themselves, may suggest some very peculiar <span class="hi">Thoughts</span> unto us.</p><p>SECT. <span class="hi">XV.</span> They were not in a constant Torture for some Weeks, but wore a little qui­et, unless upon some incidental provocations; upon <span class="hi">which</span> the <span class="hi">Devils</span> would handle them like <span class="hi">Tigres,</span> and <span class="hi">wound</span> them in a manner very hor­rible. Particularly, Upon the least <span class="hi">Reproof</span> of their <span class="hi">Parents</span> for any <span class="hi">unfit thing</span> they said or did, most grievous woful Heart-breaking <span class="hi">Agonies</span> would they fall into. If any useful thing were to be done <span class="hi">to</span> them, of <span class="hi">by them,</span> they would have all sorts of Troubles fall upon them. It would sometimes cost one of them an Hour or Two to be <span class="hi">undrest</span> in the evening, or <span class="hi">drest</span> in the morn­ing. For if any one went to <span class="hi">unty</span> a string, or <span class="hi">undo</span> a Button about them, or the contrary; they would be twisted into such postures as made the thing impossible. And at Whiles, they would he so managed in their Beds that no <span class="hi">Bed-clothes</span> could for an hour or two be laid upon them; nor could they go to <span class="hi">wash their Hands,</span> without <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d31e2680"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=49306&amp;page=14">[Page 17]</a></span> having them clasp't so odly together, there was no doing of it. But when their Friends were near tired with Waiting, anon they might do what they would unto them. Whatever Work they were <span class="hi">bid</span> to do, they would be so snap't in the member which was to do it, that they with grief still desisted from it. If one ordered them to Rub a <span class="hi">clean Table,</span> they were able to do it without any disturbance; if to rub a <span class="hi">dirty Table,</span> presently they would with many Torments be made uncapable.

Much more, All <span class="hi">Praying</span> to <span class="hi">God, &amp; Reading</span> of His <span class="hi">word,</span> would occasion a very terrible Vexation to them: they would then stop their <span class="hi">own Ears</span> with their <span class="hi">own Hands;</span> and roar, and shriek; and holla, to drown the Voice of the <span class="hi">Devotion.</span> Yea, if any one <span class="additions" id="index.xml-pb-d31e2749"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=49306&amp;page=15">[Page 18]</a></span> in the Room took up a <span class="hi">Bible</span> to look into it, the the Children could see nothing of it, as being in a croud of Spectators, or having their Faces <span class="hi">another way,</span> yet would they be in <span class="hi">wonderful</span> Mi­series, till the <span class="hi">Bible</span> were laid aside.

At the beginning of her Fits, usually she kept odly Looking up the <span class="hi">Chimney,</span> but could not say <span class="hi">what</span> she saw.

Her <span class="hi">Eyes</span> were not brought to be perpendicular to her feet, when she rose out of her Seat, as the Mechanism of a Humane Body requires in them that rise, but she was one dragg'd <span class="hi">wholly by other Hands:</span> and once, When I gave a stamp on the Hearth, just between her and the Fire, she scream'd out, (tho I think she <span class="hi">saw</span> me <span class="hi">not</span>) <span class="hi">that I Iarr'd the Chain, and hurt her Back.</span></p><p>SECT. <span class="hi">XX.</span> While she was in her <span class="hi">Frolicks</span> I was willing to try, Whether she could <span class="hi">read</span> or no; and I found, not only That <span class="hi">If she went to read the</span> Bible <span class="hi">her</span> Eyes <span class="hi">would be strangely twisted &amp; blinded, and her</span> Neck <span class="hi">presently broken, but also that if any one</span> else <span class="hi">did read the</span> Bible <span class="hi">in the Room, tho it were wholly out of her sight, and without the least voice or noise of it, she would be cast into very terrible Agonies.</span> Yet once, Falling into her her Maladies a little time after she had read the <span class="hi">59th Psalm,</span> I said unto the standers-by, Poor child! she can't now read the Psalm she readd a lit­tle while ago, she listened <span class="hi">her self</span> unto something that none of us could hear, and made us be silent for some few Seconds of a minute.

Upon this would she give a Spring as one mounting an <span class="hi">Horse,</span> and Settling her self in a <span class="hi">Riding-Posture,</span> she would in her Chair be agitated as one sometimes <span class="hi">Amble­ing,</span> sometimes <span class="hi">Trotting,</span> and sometimes <span class="hi">Gal­loping</span> very furiously.

Once being angry at his Dulness, When she said, she would cut off his head if she had a knife, I gave her my <span class="hi">Sheath, (where­with</span> she suddenly gave <span class="hi">her self</span> a stroke on the Neck, but complain'd, <span class="hi">it would not cut.</span> When she had rode a minute or <span class="hi">two</span> or <span class="hi">three,</span> shee'd pretend to be at a Rendezvous with <span class="hi">Them,</span> that were <span class="hi">Her Company;</span> there shee'd maintain a <span class="hi">Discourse</span> with them, and asking many Questions concerning <span class="hi">her self,</span> (for <span class="hi">we</span> gave her none of <span class="hi">ours</span>) shee'd <span class="hi">Listen</span> much, and Received <span class="hi">An­swers</span> from them that indeed none but her self perceived.

If any of us asked her, Who her Company were? She generally replyed, I don't know. But if we were instant in our Demand, she would with some <span class="hi">witty</span> Flout or other turn it off.

Accordingly, when her <span class="hi">Horse</span> came to her again, to our Admiration she <span class="hi">Ends</span> (that is, was <span class="hi">tossed</span> as one that <span class="hi">rode</span> up the stairs: there then stood open the <span class="hi">Stuay</span> of one belonging to the Family, into <span class="hi">which</span> entring, she stood immediately upon her Feet, and cry'd out, They are gone; they are gone! They say, that they cannot,—God won't let 'em come here! She also added a Reason for it, which the <span class="hi">Owner of the Study</span> thought more <span class="hi">kind</span> than <span class="hi">true.</span> And she presently and perfectly came to her self, so that her <span class="hi">whole Discourse</span> &amp; Carriage was altered unto the greatest measure of <span class="hi">Sobriety,</span> and she satt Reading of the <span class="hi">Bible</span> and <span class="hi">Good Books,</span> for a good part of the Afternoon. Her Affairs calling her anon to go down again, the <span class="hi">Daemons</span> were in a quarter of a minute as bad <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d31e3718"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=49306&amp;page=20">[Page 28]</a></span> upon her as before, and her <span class="hi">Horse</span> was Waiting for her. I understanding of it, <span class="hi">immediately</span> would have her up to the <span class="hi">study</span> of the young man where she had been at ease before; meerly to try Whether there had not been a Fallacy in what had newly happened: but she was now so <span class="hi">twist­ted,</span> and <span class="hi">iprithen,</span> that it gave me much trouble to get her into my Arms, and much more to drag her up the stairs. She was pulled out of my hands, and when I recovered my Hold, she was thrust so hard upon me, that I had almost fallen backwards, and her own breast was sore afterwards, by their Compressions to detain her; she seem'd heavier indeed that three of her self. With incredible Forcing (tho <span class="hi">she</span> kept Scream­ing, They say I must not go in!) at length we pull'd her in; <span class="hi">where</span> she was no sooner come, but she could stand on her Feet, and with an <span class="hi">altered tone,</span> could thank me, saying, <span class="hi">now I am well.</span> At first shee'd be somewhat faint, and say, She felt some­thing go out of her; but in a <span class="hi">minute</span> or <span class="hi">two,</span> she could attend any Devotion, or Business as well as e­ver in her Life; and both <span class="hi">spoke</span> and <span class="hi">did</span> as be­came a person of good Discretion.</p><p>I was loth to make a <span class="hi">Charm of</span> the Room; yet some strangers that came to visit us, the Week after, desiring to see the <span class="hi">Exporiment</span> made, I per­mitted more than <span class="hi">two</span> or <span class="hi">three</span> Repetitions of it; and it still succeded as I have declared.

Presently upon this her Horse re­turned, only it pestered her with such <span class="hi">ugly paces,</span> that she fell out with <span class="hi">her Company,</span> &amp; threatned now to tell all, for their so abusing her. <span class="hi">I was</span> going abroad, and she said unto them that were about her, <span class="hi">Mr. M.— is gone abroad my horse won't come back, till he come home; and then I belieue</span> (said she softly,) <span class="hi">I shall tell him all.</span> I staid abroad an hour or <span class="hi">two,</span> and then Returning, When I was just come to my Gate, before I had given the least <span class="hi">Sign</span> or <span class="hi">Noise</span> of my being there, she said, My Horse is come! and intima­ted, that I was at the Door. When I came in, I found her mounted after her fashion, upon her <span class="hi">Aerial Steed;</span> which carried her Fancy to the Journeys end. There (or rather <span class="hi">then</span>) she maintained a considerable Discourse with <span class="hi">Her Company,</span> Listening very attentively when she had propounded any Question, and receiving the <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d31e3866"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=49306&amp;page=21">[Page 30]</a></span> <span class="hi">Answers</span> with impressions made upon her mind.

The children were miserably tortured, while we laboured in our <span class="hi">Prayers;</span> but our good God was high unto us, in what we call'd upon Him for. From this day the power of the Enemy was broken; and the children, though Assaults after this were made upon them, yet were not <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d31e4044"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=49306&amp;page=22">[Page 32]</a></span> so cruelly handled as before. The <span class="hi">Liberty</span> of the Children encreased daily more and more, and their <span class="hi">Vexation</span> abated by degrees; till with­in a little while they arrived to <span class="hi">Perfect Ease,</span> which for some <span class="hi">weeks</span> or <span class="hi">months</span> they <span class="hi">cheerfully</span> en­joyed. Thus <span class="hi">Good it is for us to draw near to God.</span></p><p>SECT. <span class="hi">XXVI.</span> Within a day or <span class="hi">two</span> after the <span class="hi">East,</span> the young Woman had two remarka­ble Attempts made upon her, by her invisible Adversaries. Once, <span class="hi">they were Dragging her in­to the Oven that was then heating,</span> while there was none in the Room to help her. She clap't her hands on the <span class="hi">Mantle-tree</span> to save her self; but they were beaten off; and she had been burned, if at her Out-cryes one had not come in from a­broad for her Relief. Another time, <span class="hi">they</span> putt an unseen <span class="hi">Rope</span> with a cruel <span class="hi">Noose</span> about her Neck, Whereby she was choaked, until she was black in the Face; and though it was taken off before it had kill'd her, yet there were the red Marks of <span class="hi">it,</span> and of a <span class="hi">Finger</span> &amp; a <span class="hi">Thumb</span> near it, remaining to be seen for a while afterwards.</p><p>SECT. <span class="hi">XXVII.</span> This was the last Molest­ation that <span class="hi">they</span> gave her for a While; and she dwelt at my house the rest of the Winter, hav­ing by an obliging and vertuous Conversation, made her self enough Welcome to the Family. But within about a Fortnight, she was visited with <span class="hi">two dayes</span> of as Extraordinary Obsessions as any we had been the Spectators of. I thought it <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d31e4132"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=49306&amp;page=22">[Page 33]</a></span> convenient for me to entertain my Congregati­on with a <span class="hi">Sermon</span> upon the <span class="hi">memorable Providences</span> which these Children had been concerned in. When I had begun to study my Sermon, her <span class="hi">Tor­mentors</span> again seiz'd upon her; and all <span class="hi">Fryday</span> &amp; <span class="hi">Saturday,</span> did <span class="hi">they</span> manage her with a special De­sign, as was plain, to disturb me in what I was about. In the worst of her extravagancies for­merly, she was more dutiful to my self than I had reason to Expect, but <span class="hi">now</span> her <span class="hi">whole</span> carriage to me, was with a Sauciness that I had not been us'd to be treated with. She would knock at my Study <span class="hi">Door,</span> affirming, <span class="hi">That some below would be glad to see me;</span> when there was none that ask't for me. She would call to me with multiply­ed Impertinencies, and throw small things at me wherewith she could not give me any hurt. Shee'd Hector me at a strange rate for the <span class="hi">work</span> I was at, and threaten me with <span class="hi">I know not what</span> mischief for it. She got a <span class="hi">History</span> that I had Written of this <span class="hi">Witchcraft,</span> and tho she had be­fore this, readd it over and over, yet now she could not read (I believe) one entire Sen­tence of it; but she made of it the most ridicu­lous <span class="hi">Travesty</span> in the World, with such a Patness and excess of Fancy, to supply the sense that she put upon it, as I was amazed at. And she par­ticularly told me, That <span class="hi">I should quickly come to dis­grace by that History.</span></p><p><span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d31e4209"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=49306&amp;page=23">[Page 34]</a></span>SECT. <span class="hi">XXVIII.</span> But there were many other Wonders beheld by us before these two dayes were out. <span class="hi">Few tortures</span> attended her, but such as were <span class="hi">provoked;</span> her <span class="hi">Frolicks</span> being the things that had most possession of her. I was in <span class="hi">Latin</span> telling some young Gentlemen of the <span class="hi">Col­ledge,</span> That if I should bid her <span class="hi">Look</span> to God, her <span class="hi">Eyes</span> would be put out, upon <span class="hi">which</span> her eyes were presently served so. I was in some surprize, When I saw that her <span class="hi">Troublers</span> understood <span class="hi">La­tin,</span> and it made me willing to try a little more of <span class="hi">their</span> Capacity. We continually found, that if an <span class="hi">English Bible</span> were in any part of the <span class="hi">Room</span> seriously look'd into, though she <span class="hi">saw</span> and <span class="hi">heard</span> nothing of it, she would immediately be in very dismal <span class="hi">Agonies.</span> We now made a Tryal more than once or twice, of the <span class="hi">Greek</span> New-Testament, and the <span class="hi">Hebrew</span> Old Testament; and We still found, That if one should go to read in it never so secretly and silently, it would procure her that Anguish, Which there was no enduring of. But, I thought, (at length,) I fell upon one <span class="hi">infi­rior</span> Language which the <span class="hi">Damons</span> did not seem, <span class="hi">so well</span> to understand.</p><p>SECT. <span class="hi">XXIX. Devotion</span> was now, as <span class="hi">for­merly</span> the terriblest of all the provocations that could be given her. I could by no means bring her to <span class="hi">own,</span> That <span class="hi">she desired the mercies of God and the prayers of good men.</span> I would have ob­tained a <span class="hi">Sign</span> of such a Desire, by her Listing <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d31e4308"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=49306&amp;page=23">[Page 35]</a></span> up of her hand; but she stirr'd it not: I then listed up her hand my self, and though the stan­ders by thought a more insignificant thing could not be propounded, I said, Child, If you desire those things, let your hand <span class="hi">fall,</span> when I take mine a­way: I took my hand away, and hers continu­ed strangely and <span class="hi">stifly</span> stretched out, so that for some time, she could not take it <span class="hi">down.</span> During these two dayes we had Prayers oftener in our Family than at other times; and this was her usual Behaviour at them. The man that prayed, usually began with <span class="hi">Reading</span> the <span class="hi">Word of God;</span> which once as he was going to do, she call'd to him, Read of <span class="hi">Mary Magdalen,</span> out of whom the Lord cast seven Devils, During the time of <span class="hi">Rea­ding,</span> she would be laid as one fast asleep; but when <span class="hi">Prayer</span> was begun, the Devils would still <span class="hi">throw her on the Floor,</span> at the feet of him, that prayed. There would she lye and Whistle and sing and roar, to <span class="hi">drown</span> the voice of the Prayer; but that being a little too audible for <span class="hi">Them,</span> they would shutt close her <span class="hi">Mouth</span> and her ears, and yet make such odd noises in her <span class="hi">Throat</span> as that she her self could not hear our Cries to God for her. Shee'd also fetch very terrible <span class="hi">Blowes</span> with her Fist, and <span class="hi">Kicks</span> with her Foot at the man that prayed; but still (for he had bid that none should hinder her) her <span class="hi">Fist</span> and <span class="hi">Foot,</span> would alwaies recoil, when they came within a few hairs breadths of him just as if Rebounding <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d31e4372"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=49306&amp;page=24">[Page 36]</a></span> against a Wall; so that she touch'd him not, but then would beg hard of <span class="hi">other people</span> to strike him, and particularly she entreated them to take the <span class="hi">Tongs</span> and smite him; Which not being done, she cryed out of him, <span class="hi">He has wounded me in the Head.</span> But before Prayer was out, she would be laid for <span class="hi">Dead,</span> wholly <span class="hi">sensless</span> and (unless to a severe Trial) <span class="hi">Breathless;</span> with her Belly swel­led like a <span class="hi">Drum,</span> and sometimes with croaking Noises in it; thus would she ly, most exactly with the stiffness and posture of one that had been two Days laid out for Dead. Once lying thus, as he that was praying, was alluding to the words of the <span class="hi">Canaanitess,</span> and saying, <span class="hi">Lord, have mercy on a Daughter vexed with a Devil;</span> there came a <span class="hi">big,</span> but <span class="hi">low</span> voice from her, say­ing, <span class="hi">There's Two or Three of them</span> (or <span class="hi">us!</span>) and the standers-by, were under that Apprehension, as that they cannot relate whether her <span class="hi">mouth mov'd</span> in speaking of it. When Prayer was end­ed, she would Revive in a minute or two, and continue as Frolicksome as before. She thus con­tinued until <span class="hi">Saturday</span> towards the Evening; when, after this man had been at Prayer, I char­ged all my Family to admit of no Diversion by her Frolicks, from such exercises as it was pro­per to begin the Sabbath with. They took the Coun<span class="gap" title="〈…〉"> [...]</span>; and tho she essayed, with as witty and and as nimble and as various an Application to each of them successively as ever I saw, to make <span class="additions" id="index.xml-pb-d31e4439"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=49306&amp;page=24">[Page 37]</a></span> them laugh, yet they kept close to their <span class="hi">good Books</span> which then called for their Atten­tion. When she saw <span class="hi">that,</span> immediately she fell asleep; and in <span class="hi">two</span> or <span class="hi">three</span> hours, she waked perfectly <span class="hi">her self;</span> weeping bitterly to remember (for as one come out of a dream she could re­member) what had befallen her.</p><p>SECT. <span class="hi">XXX.</span> After this, we had no more such entertainments. The <span class="hi">Demons</span> it may be would once or twice in a Week, trouble her for a few minutes with perhaps a <span class="hi">twisting</span> &amp; a <span class="hi">twinke</span> of her eyes, or a certain <span class="hi">Cough,</span> which did seem to be more than ordinary. Moreover, Both she at my house, and her Sister at <span class="hi">home,</span> at the time which they call <span class="hi">Christmas,</span> were by the <span class="hi">Dae­mons</span> made very <span class="hi">drunk,</span> though they had no <span class="hi">strong</span> Drink (as we are fully sure) to make them so. When she began to feel her selfe thus <span class="hi">drunk,</span> she complain'd, <span class="hi">O they say they will have me to keep</span> Christmas <span class="hi">with them! They will disgrace me when they can do nothing else!</span> And immediately the Ridiculous Behaviours of one <span class="hi">drunk,</span> were with a wonderful exactness represented in her Speaking, and Reeling, and Spewing, and anon Sleeping, till she was well again.

But how this <span class="hi">twice doubled</span> affliction is <span class="hi">doubled</span> again. <span class="hi">Two</span> more of my Children are smitten down, oh! the Cries, the Shrieks, the Tortures of these poor Children! <span class="hi">Doctors</span> cannot help, <span class="hi">Parents</span> weep and lament over them, but cannot ease them. Now I considering my affliction to be <span class="hi">more than ordinary,</span> it did certainly call for <span class="hi">more than ordinary</span> Prayer. I acquainted Mr. <span class="hi">Allen,</span> Mr. <span class="hi">Moodey,</span> Mr. <span class="hi">Willard,</span> and Mr. <span class="hi">C. Mather,</span> the four Ministers of the Town with it, and Mr. <span class="hi">Morton</span> of <span class="hi">Charlstown;</span> earnestly desiring them, that they, with some other <span class="hi">praying people</span> of God, would meet at my house, and there be earnest with God, on the behalf of us and our Children; which they (I thank them for it) readily at­tended with great servency of Spirit; but as for my part, my heart was ready to sink to hear and see those <span class="hi">doleful-Sights.</span> Now I thought that I had greatly neglected my duty to my <span class="hi">Children,</span> <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d31e5347"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=49306&amp;page=30">[Page 48]</a></span> in not admonishing and instructing of them; and that God was hereby calling my sins to mind, to slay my <span class="hi">Children,</span> Then I pondered of that place in Numb. 23. 23. <span class="hi">Surely there is no Inchanment against Iacob, neither is there any De­vination against Israel.</span> And now I thought I had broke <span class="hi">Covenant with God,</span> not only in <span class="hi">one</span> respect but in <span class="hi">many,</span> but it pleased the Lord to bring that to mind in <span class="hi">Heb.</span> 8. 12. <span class="hi">For I will be mer­ciful to their unrighteousness, and their Sins &amp; In­quities will I remember no more.</span> The Considerati­on how the Lord did deal with <span class="hi">Iob,</span> and his <span class="hi">Pa­tience</span> and the <span class="hi">End the Lord made with him</span> was some support to me. I thought also, on what <span class="hi">David</span> said, that He had sinned, but what have these poor <span class="hi">Lambs</span> done? But yet in the midds't of my tumultous Thoughts within me, it was <span class="hi">Gods Comforts that did delight my soul. That in the</span> 18 of <span class="hi">Luke,</span> and the Beginning, Where Christ <span class="hi">spake the Parable for that end,</span> that men ought <span class="hi">alwaies to pray and not</span> faint. <span class="hi">This,</span> with many other places bore up my spirit. I thought with <span class="hi">Ionah</span> that I <span class="hi">would yet again Look towards God's holy Tem­ple; the Lord Iesus Christ.</span> And I did greatly desire to find the <span class="hi">Son of God</span> with me in this <span class="hi">Fur­nace of Affliction,</span> knowing thereby that no harm shall befall me. But now this solemn <span class="hi">day of Prayer and Fasting</span> being at an <span class="hi">End,</span> there was an <span class="hi">Eminent</span> Answer of it: for one of my Children was delivered, and <span class="hi">one</span> of the wicked instruments <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d31e5442"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=49306&amp;page=30">[Page 49]</a></span> of the Devil discovered, <span class="hi">and her own mouth con­demned her,</span> and so accordingly Executed. Here was <span class="hi">Food for Faith,</span> and great encouragement still to <span class="hi">hope and quietly wait for the Salvation of the Lord;</span> the Ministers still counselling and encou­raging me to labour to be found in <span class="hi">Gods way,</span> committing my case to him, and not to use any way not allowed in Gods Word. It was a thing not a little comfortable to us, to see that the people of God was so much concerned about our lamentable condition, remembring us <span class="hi">at all times</span> in their <span class="hi">prayers,</span> which I did look at as a token for good; but you must think it was a time of sore Temptation with us, for <span class="hi">many</span> did say; (yea, and some <span class="hi">good</span> people too) were it their case, that they would <span class="hi">try some Tricks,</span> that should give ease to their Children: But I thought for us to forsake the counsel of <span class="hi">good old men,</span> and to take the counsel of the <span class="hi">young ones,</span> it might ensnare our <span class="hi">Souls,</span> though for the present it might <span class="hi">offer</span> some relief to our <span class="hi">Bodies;</span> which was a thing I greatly feared; and <span class="hi">my Children</span> were not at any time free for doing any such thing. It was a time of sore <span class="hi">affliction,</span> but it was mixed with abundance of <span class="hi">mercy,</span> for my heart was ma­ny a time made glad in the <span class="hi">house of Prayer.</span> The <span class="hi">Neighbourhood</span> pitied us; and were very helpful to us: Moreover, though my Children were thus in every Limb and Joynt tormented by those Children of the Devil, they also using their <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d31e5511"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=49306&amp;page=31">[Page 50]</a></span> tongues at their pleasure, sometimes one way, sometimes another; yet the Lord did herein pre­vent them, that they <span class="hi">could not make them speak wicked words,</span> though they did many times hinder them from speaking <span class="hi">good ones;</span> had they in these Fits <span class="hi">blasphemed</span> the Name of the Holy God, this you may think would have been an heart-break­ing thing to us the poor Parents; but God in his mercy prevented them, a thing worth taking notice of. Likewise they <span class="hi">slept well</span> a nights: And the <span class="hi">Ministers</span> did often visit us, and pray with us, and for us; and their love and pity was so great, their Prayers so earnest and con­stant, that I could not but admire at it. <span class="hi">Mr. Mather</span> particularly; now his bowels so yearned towards us in this sad condition, that he not only <span class="hi">pray's</span> with us, and for us, but he taketh one of my Children home to his own house; which indeed was but a troublesome <span class="hi">guest,</span> for such an one that had so much work lying upon his hands and heart: He took much pains in this great Service, to pull <span class="hi">this Child,</span> and her Brother and Sister out of the hand of the <span class="hi">Devil.</span> Let us now admire and adore that <span class="hi">Fountain</span> the Lord Jesus Christ, from whence those <span class="hi">streams</span> come. The Lord himself will requite his labour of love. Our case is yet very sad, and doth call for more <span class="hi">Prayer;</span> and the good Ministers of this Town, and <span class="hi">Charlstown</span> readily came, with some other good praying people to my house, to keep ano­ther <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d31e5566"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=49306&amp;page=31">[Page 51]</a></span> Day of solemn Fasting and Prayer; which our Lord saith <span class="hi">this kind goeth out by.</span> My Child­ren being all at home, the two biggest lying on the bed, one of them would fain have <span class="hi">Kicked</span> the good men while they were wrestling with God for them, had not I held him with all my power and might; and sometimes he would stop his <span class="hi">own</span> ears. This you must needs think was a cut­ting thing to the poor parents. Now our hearts were ready to sink, had not God put under his everlasting arms of Mercy and helped us still to hope in his mercy, and to <span class="hi">be quiet,</span> knowing that <span class="hi">He is God,</span> and that it was not for the <span class="hi">potsheards</span> of the earth to strive with their Maker. Well might <span class="hi">David</span> say, that had not the <span class="hi">Law of his God been his delight, he had perished in his Affliction.</span> Now the <span class="hi">Promises of God</span> are sweet; God having promised, to <span class="hi">hear the prayer of the destitute,</span> and <span class="hi">not to despise their prayer;</span> and <span class="hi">He will not fail the Expectation of those that wait on Him;</span> but He <span class="hi">heareth the cry of the poor and needy.</span> These <span class="hi">Ia­cobs</span> came and <span class="hi">wrestled</span> with God for a <span class="hi">Blessing</span> on this poor Family, which indeed I hope they ob­tained, and may be now worthy of the Name <span class="hi">Is­rael,</span> who prevailed with God, and <span class="hi">would not let Him go till He had blessed us.</span> For <span class="hi">soon</span> after this, there were <span class="hi">two more</span> of my children delivered out of this <span class="hi">horrible pit.</span> Here was now a <span class="hi">double mercy,</span> and how <span class="hi">sweet</span> was it, knowing it came in <span class="hi">An­swer of Prayer!</span> Now we see and know, <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d31e5657"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=49306&amp;page=32">[Page 52]</a></span> <span class="hi">it is not a vain thing to call on the name of the Lord.</span> For He is a <span class="hi">present help in the time of trouble;</span> and we may boldly say <span class="hi">the Lord has been our helper,</span> I had <span class="hi">sunk,</span> but Jesus put forth His hand &amp; bore me up.

Only before they parted, the Devil being so urgent upon him, telling him he <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d31e7176"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=49306&amp;page=39">[Page 67]</a></span> had baffled with him, he set <span class="hi">a year and half</span> time for Consideration. The <span class="hi">last</span> quarter of a year is yet to come. The Devil told him, if he let him alone so long, he would baffle with him <span class="hi">still:</span> he answered, if he did not yeild <span class="hi">then,</span> he would give him leave to torment him whilst he lived. Still the Devil would not away, nor could <span class="hi">he</span> get from him. Then out of Fear he cryed out, <span class="hi">Lord, Iesus, rebuke the devil!</span> at which, the <span class="hi">Fox, Pen, Ink</span> and <span class="hi">Paper</span> vanished. Yet he continued in his course of unheard-of Wickedness, and still his <span class="hi">Will</span> was bent to <span class="hi">write &amp; seal</span> the Agreement, having his Discourse yet with <span class="hi">Satan</span> by <span class="hi">Voice.</span> His Brother with whom he lives at <span class="hi">Tocut,</span> hav­ing <span class="hi">Convulsion Fits,</span> he laughed and mocked at him, and acted the <span class="hi">Convulsion Fits.</span> A while af­ter God sent <span class="hi">Convulsion Fits</span> on himself; in which time, his former Terrours, the Wrath of God, <span class="hi">Death, Hell, Iudgment,</span> and <span class="hi">Eternity</span> were pre­sented to him. He would fain then have confes­sed his sins, but when he was about to do it, the <span class="hi">Devil</span> still held his mouth, that he could not. He <span class="hi">entreated</span> God, to <span class="hi">release</span> him, promising to <span class="hi">con­fess &amp; forsake</span> his Sins, and the Lord did so; but he being <span class="hi">well,</span> grew as bad, or worse than ever. About six weeks since, his <span class="hi">Convulsion Fits</span> came again three times most dreadfully, with some Intermissions, and his former Horrours &amp; Fears. He would have confessed his Sins but could not. It pleased God to put it into the heart of one to <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d31e7265"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=49306&amp;page=40">[Page 68]</a></span> ask him, <span class="hi">Whether he had any Familiarity with the Devil?</span> he got out so much then as, <span class="hi">Yes.</span> He fetching Mr. <span class="hi">Pierson,</span> the Convulsion Fits <span class="hi">left</span> him, and he confessed all, how it had been with him. That very night the Devil came to him, and told him, <span class="hi">Had he blabbed out such things? He would teach him to blabb!</span> and if he would not <span class="hi">then write</span> and <span class="hi">seal</span> the Agreement, he would tear him in pieces, and he refusing, the Devil took a <span class="hi">corporal Possession</span> of him, and hath not ceased to torment him extremely ever since. If any thing be spoken to him, the <span class="hi">Devil</span> answereth (and many times he <span class="hi">barks</span> like a <span class="hi">Fox,</span> and <span class="hi">hisseth</span> like a <span class="hi">Serpent</span>) sometimes with horrible <span class="hi">Blasphemies</span> against the Name of Christ; and at some other times the Boy is sensible. When he hath the Libertie of his <span class="hi">Voice,</span> he tells what the Devil saith to him, urging him to <span class="hi">seal</span> the Covenant still, and that he will bring <span class="hi">Paper, Pen</span> and <span class="hi">Ink</span> in the night, when none shall see, pleading, that <span class="hi">God hath oust him off,</span> that <span class="hi">Christ cannot save him.</span> That When He was upon <span class="hi">earth</span> He could cast out devils, but now He is in <span class="hi">Heaven</span> He cannot. Some­times he is ready to yeild to all in a <span class="hi">desperate</span> way. Sometimes he breaks out into <span class="hi">Confession</span> of his former sins, as they come into his mind; ex­ceedingly <span class="hi">judging</span> himself, and <span class="hi">justifying</span> GOD in His for ever leaving of him in the hands of <span class="hi">Sa­tan.</span> Once he was heard to <span class="hi">Pray</span> in such a man­ner so sutable to his Condition, so Aggra­vating <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d31e7367"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=49306&amp;page=40">[Page 69]</a></span> his Sin, and pleading with God for mercy, and in such a strange, high, enlarged manner, as judicious godly persons then present, affirm <span class="hi">they never heard the like in their lives,</span> that it drew a­bundance of tears from the eyes of all present, being about twenty persons. But his torment increased upon him worse after such a time; or if any thing were spoken to him from the <span class="hi">Word of God</span> by others or they pray with him. The last week after he had confessed one strange Pas­sage, namely that once in Discourse he told the Devil, that if <span class="hi">he</span> would make his <span class="hi">Spittle to scald a dog,</span> he would then go on in a way of <span class="hi">Lying</span> and <span class="hi">Dissembling,</span> and believe that he <span class="hi">should</span> do it, which he said, <span class="hi">he did</span> with all his heart, and so <span class="hi">spit</span> on the <span class="hi">dog,</span> and with that a deal of <span class="hi">Scald­ing Water</span> did poure on the Dog. In pursu­ance of his Promise, he went on in a way of <span class="hi">Ly­ing</span> and <span class="hi">Dissembling:</span> That when he was urged about it, that he had done some mischief to the <span class="hi">dog,</span> then he fell down into a Swound as if he had been dead. As soon as he had confessed <span class="hi">this,</span> the Devil went out of him with an astonishing <span class="hi">Noise,</span> to the terrour of those then, present: and so he continued <span class="hi">one day.</span> The next day being much troubled in himself for one special passage in his Discourse with the Devil, when he ap­peared to him as a <span class="hi">Fox;</span> saith he to he Devil, <span class="hi">I have formerly sought to God, an<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span> H<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span> <span class="gap" title="••"> [...]</span>th been near unto me:</span> With that the Devil enraged, <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d31e7454"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=49306&amp;page=41">[Page 70]</a></span> said unto him then, <span class="hi">What, are you got hither</span> and fell to Threatning of him. He said to him again, <span class="hi">But I find no such Thoughts</span> now, <span class="hi">but</span> do <span class="hi">&amp; will believe you now more than the Word of God which saith in</span> Isa. 55, <span class="hi">Seek the Lord</span> &amp;c. and said further, <span class="hi">What comfort you shall afford me, I shall rely upon you for it.</span> Remembring this Passage the Devil appeared to him, ready to enter into him again. Thereby much astonished, having the <span class="hi">Bible in his hand,</span> he opened it, &amp;, as it were of it self, at <span class="hi">that</span> place of <span class="hi">Isai.</span> 55: his <span class="hi">Eye</span> was fixed upon it, and his <span class="hi">Conscience</span> accusing him for abusing the <span class="hi">Word</span> a year ago, his heart failing him, and the Devil entred into him again a <span class="hi">Se­cond time,</span> railing upon him, &amp; calling him, <span class="hi">Blab-tongue,</span> and <span class="hi">Rogue!</span> he had <span class="hi">promis'd to keep things secret,</span> he <span class="hi">would teach him to blabb,</span> he <span class="hi">would tear him in peices.</span> Since, he hath kept his Body in continual <span class="hi">Motion,</span> speaking <span class="hi">in</span> him, and <span class="hi">by</span> him, with a <span class="hi">formidable Voice:</span> sometimes singing of <span class="hi">Verses</span> wicked and witty, that formerly he had made against his Father's <span class="hi">Ministry,</span> and the <span class="hi">Word of God</span> &amp;c. When the <span class="hi">Boy</span> is come to himself, they tell him of them, and he <span class="hi">owns</span> them, that indeed <span class="hi">such</span> he did make. Mr. <span class="hi">Eaton</span> being his Uncle, sent a <span class="hi">Letter</span> to him, which he told of be­fore it came saying also, it would be <span class="hi">goodly stuff!</span> Jeering at him. By and by the Letter came in, and <span class="hi">none</span> of the people knew of it before. He speaks of men coming to him before they come <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d31e7561"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=49306&amp;page=41">[Page 71]</a></span> in Sight: and once <span class="hi">two</span> being with him, their <span class="hi">Backs</span> turned, the Devil carried him away, they knew not how, &amp; after <span class="hi">search</span> they found him in a <span class="hi">Cellar,</span> as <span class="hi">dead,</span> but after a little space he came to Life again. And another time, threw him up into a <span class="hi">Chamber,</span> stopped him up into a <span class="hi">Hole,</span> where they after found him. Another time he carried him about a <span class="hi">Bow-Shot</span> and threw him in­to a <span class="hi">Hog-Stye</span> amongst <span class="hi">Swine,</span> which ran away with a terrible noise.</p><p>Here is as much to be seen of the <span class="hi">Venome of Sin,</span> the <span class="hi">Wrath of God</span> against <span class="hi">Sin,</span> the <span class="hi">Malice of the Devil,</span> and yet his <span class="hi">limited Power,</span> and the <span class="hi">Reasonings of Satan</span> in an <span class="hi">ocular</span> Demonstration, as hath fallen out in any Age.

He grew indisposed in his <span class="hi">Body</span> very unaccountably; and one day repaired unto a <span class="hi">Church Meeting</span> then held in the place, with a Resolution there to declare what he had <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d31e7745"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=49306&amp;page=42">[Page 73]</a></span> met withal.

He pray'd with a more than usu­al measure of both Devotion and Discretion, but just as he was coming to that part of his Prayer, wherein he intended to petition Heaven for the <span class="hi">Discovery of Witchcrafts</span> which had been among them, he sank down <span class="hi">Speechless</span> and <span class="hi">Sense­less;</span> and was by his Friends carried away to a <span class="hi">Bed;</span> where he lay for two or three hours in horrible Distress, fearfully starting, and sta­ring and crying out <span class="hi">Lord, I am stab'd!</span> and now looking whistly to and fro, he said, <span class="hi">O here are wicked persons among us, even among VS;</span> and he complained, <span class="hi">I came hither with a full purpose to tell what I knew, but now</span> (said he) <span class="hi">I ly like a Fool!</span> Thus he continued until the Meeting was over, and then his Fits left him; only he re­mained very sore. One or two more such Fits he had after that; but afterwards a more <span class="hi">pri­vate</span> sort of <span class="hi">Torture</span> was employ'd upon him. He was advised by a worthy man to apply him­self unto a Magistrate; and warned, That he would shortly be murdered, if he did not.

The fond <span class="hi">Sadducee</span> derides <span class="hi">the Doctrine of Devils,</span> <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d31e8191"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=49306&amp;page=45">[Page 3]</a></span> which we all embrace. But I pray, What things were those that <span class="hi">left their first estate,</span> being now <span class="hi">reserved in chains of darkness to the judgment of the great day?</span> What things be those that be­sought our Lord of liberty to <span class="hi">enter into the swine?</span> But we have among our selves lately seen plain Demonstrations, That there are <span class="hi">Spirits,</span> which <span class="hi">understand,</span> and <span class="hi">argue,</span> and <span class="hi">will;</span> and which are the enemies of all that is <span class="hi">holy,</span> and <span class="hi">just,</span> &amp; <span class="hi">Good.</span></p><p>We may, Secondly, Conclude, That these <span class="hi">De­vils</span> are an <span class="hi">Army</span> in our <span class="hi">Air.</span> They are called in <span class="hi">Eph.</span> 2. 2. <span class="hi">the power</span> (or the Army) <span class="hi">of the air.</span> There are diverse Miles of <span class="hi">Air</span> encompassing of this Terraqueous <span class="hi">Globe;</span> to that <span class="hi">space</span> it is that the <span class="hi">Devils</span> are limited, since their <span class="hi">High-Treason</span> against the God that made them.

Indeed, <span class="hi">some</span> Devils may keep more constantly to <span class="hi">one</span> countrey, and some to <span class="hi">another.</span> Hence we read of some in <span class="hi">Marc.</span> 5. 10. <span class="hi">They be sought our Lord much, that He would not send them away out of the Countrey.</span> But still the <span class="hi">High-Places</span> of our <span class="hi">air</span> be the Receptacles of all the <span class="hi">wicked Spirits.</span></p><p>We may conclude, Thirdly, That these <span class="hi">Devils</span> are an <span class="hi">Army</span> under a <span class="hi">Leader</span> too. There is a <span class="hi">Government,</span> a <span class="hi">Monarchy</span> in the dark Regions; and hence in <span class="hi">Matth.</span> 12. 24. we read about Belzchub, the <span class="hi">Prince</span> of devils.

We have Mention in the Sacred Oracles, of, <span class="hi">the devil and his angels.</span> This <span class="hi">cheef devil</span> is called by way of eminency, <span class="hi">the</span> De­vil; but he has innumerable <span class="hi">Slaves,</span> and <span class="hi">Officers,</span> and <span class="hi">Emissaries,</span> which are under an entire Subjec­tion to him. His Orders they all observe; and therefore, when we speak of <span class="hi">the Devil,</span> it in­cludeth each private <span class="hi">Souldier</span> as well as him that is <span class="hi">principal Commander.</span> We say, <span class="hi">The Devil,</span> as we say, <span class="hi">The Turk,</span> or <span class="hi">The Spaniard;</span> it means <span class="hi">any</span> or <span class="hi">every</span> part of that infernal <span class="hi">Ren­dezvous.</span> As it is said in <span class="hi">Ps.</span> 34. 6. <span class="hi">The Angel of the Lord encamps, i. e.</span> the whole Host of Angels are as <span class="hi">One</span> in it.</p><p><span class="hi">Prop.</span> II. The <span class="hi">Divels</span> are the <span class="hi">great Adversa­ries</span> of humane <span class="hi">Souls.</span> Tis here said about the <span class="hi">devil,</span> He is <span class="hi">your</span> Adversary; or as the Article in­timates, he is <span class="hi">that</span> your Adversary.</p><p>If it be asked, <span class="hi">How</span> the Devils are our Ad­versaries? In general they labour to do us all the mischief they can <span class="hi">devise.</span> They pursue our Hurt in all <span class="hi">waies,</span> and by all <span class="hi">means.</span> Yet in <span class="hi">some</span> sense they <span class="hi">cannot</span> come at us unless <span class="hi">according to Law.</span> Know, That the Greek word here notes <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d31e8473"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=49306&amp;page=46">[Page 5]</a></span> properly an <span class="hi">Adversary at Law;</span> tis a <span class="hi">law-Term</span> that is used here. Thus First, the Devils are our Adversaries as <span class="hi">Accusers.</span> Tis the Character of the Devil in <span class="hi">Rev.</span> 12. 10. The <span class="hi">Accuser</span> of our Brethren, which <span class="hi">accuseth</span> them before God, day and night. He is called a <span class="hi">Satan,</span> and a <span class="hi">Devil</span> for this very Cause. The Devils are first our <span class="hi">Tempters,</span> and then our <span class="hi">Accusers.</span> They complain to God against us, that we do not <span class="hi">fear</span> Him, that we do not <span class="hi">love</span> Him, that we do not <span class="hi">seek</span> Him, as we ought to do: they represent our faults before the Lord, as things that make us unfit for any Mercy at His hands. There is a <span class="hi">Court</span> kept some­where in the <span class="hi">Invisible world,</span> at which, Devils endeavour to prefer as many <span class="hi">Complaints</span> as they they <span class="hi">can</span> against us. They first <span class="hi">gett</span> and then <span class="hi">bring</span> matters of Accusation which we might be <span class="hi">Indicted</span> and <span class="hi">Condemned</span> for.</p><p>Secondly, The Devils are our Adversaries as <span class="hi">Destroyers.</span> They <span class="hi">plead</span> and <span class="hi">pray</span> as so many <span class="hi">At­tourneys,</span> that a <span class="hi">Iudgment</span> may be granted against us all; and then they petition that <span class="hi">they</span> too may be the <span class="hi">Executioners</span> of it. Tis illustrated in <span class="hi">Iob.</span> 1. 11. and 2. 5. <span class="hi">Satan</span> urges upon God against <span class="hi">Iob, put forth thine hand now, and touch his bone and his flesh.</span> They would fain have all manner of Miseries to be inflicted on us; and they try all they can to gain <span class="hi">Opportunities</span> for doing <span class="hi">their</span> part that we may be miserable. A <span class="hi">Devil</span> is called a <span class="hi">destroying Angel.</span> They are <span class="hi">Devils</span> usually that <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d31e8595"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=49306&amp;page=46">[Page 6]</a></span> are the Instruments of Divine Vengeance on the world. If it be asked, <span class="hi">Why</span> the devils are our Adversaries? There is a double Reason to be Assigned of it. One Reason of it is,</p><p>Their <span class="hi">Hatred of God.</span> The Devils have sha­ken off the <span class="hi">Law,</span> and the <span class="hi">Rule</span> of God; and they cannot hear that the <span class="hi">Name</span> of God should be ac­knowledged in the world. <span class="hi">GOD</span> and the <span class="hi">De­vils</span> are sworn enemies to each other; and the Lord may say of them as in <span class="hi">Zeb.</span> 11. 8. <span class="hi">My soul loathed them, and their soul also abhorred me.</span> Now the poor Children of men, both do the <span class="hi">Service</span> of God, and have the <span class="hi">Image</span> of God. We do the <span class="hi">Service</span> of God. Man is the <span class="hi">Priest</span> of the whole <span class="hi">visible Creation.</span> Tis by our <span class="hi">Thoughts,</span> tis by our <span class="hi">Words,</span> that all things else pay their Homage un- the Lord. The <span class="hi">Devil,</span> that would be in the <span class="hi">Throne</span> of God, would ruine us, that God may no more have the <span class="hi">Honour</span> of a <span class="hi">Father,</span> or the <span class="hi">Fear</span> of a <span class="hi">Master</span> in the world. We also have the <span class="hi">I­mage</span> of God. In our <span class="hi">Nature</span> there is <span class="hi">much,</span> in our <span class="hi">Vertue</span> there is <span class="hi">more</span> of God's Likeness. The Devil is a <span class="hi">Tigre;</span> they report of that wild beast, it will tear the <span class="hi">picture</span> of a man, when it cannot reach the <span class="hi">person</span> of a man. There is a <span class="hi">lively shadow,</span> as it were, of God, upon us; and this the Tigres of <span class="hi">Hell</span> cannot endure.</p><p>A Second Reason of it is, their <span class="hi">Envy</span> at <span class="hi">Man.</span> The <span class="hi">Devils</span> behold <span class="hi">Man</span> exalted &amp; advanced a­bove themselves. Tis said of the <span class="hi">Leviathan</span> in <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d31e8728"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=49306&amp;page=47">[Page 7]</a></span> <span class="hi">Iob</span> 41. 34. <span class="hi">He beholdeth all high things.</span> Tis ful­filled in the <span class="hi">Pope</span> also, and lastly in the <span class="hi">Devil.</span> He cannot brook it, that any should be <span class="hi">higher</span> than himself. The Apostle intimates, that <span class="hi">Pride</span> was at first, <span class="hi">the Condemnation of the Devil.</span> Tis con­jectured, that the Devil being informed of God's decree to have a <span class="hi">Man</span> subsist in the Second Per­son of the <span class="hi">Trinity;</span> this provoked him and his Accomplices to their Disobedience. However, the Devil now sees <span class="hi">Man Saved</span> and <span class="hi">himself dum­ned; Man</span> in the Bosom of God, and <span class="hi">himself</span> in the Bottom of <span class="hi">Hell; Well,</span> now thinks he, I will do this <span class="hi">Man</span> all the spite I can.</p><p><span class="hi">Prop.</span> III. The <span class="hi">Devils</span> are <span class="hi">potent</span> Adversa­ries of our Souls.</p><p>The Devil is a <span class="hi">Lion,</span> and as it was said in <span class="hi">Judg.</span> 14. 18. <span class="hi">What is stronger than a Lion?</span> He has a <span class="hi">Power,</span> an <span class="hi">Interest,</span> that may make us all to trem­ble at his Roaring. Hence we read in <span class="hi">Luc.</span> 10. 19. about <span class="hi">The power of the enemy:</span> and he is com­pared in <span class="hi">Cap.</span> 11. 21. unto, <span class="hi">A strong Armed man.</span></p><p>There be <span class="hi">three</span> things that show the power of our Adversaries.</p><p>First, The power of our Adversaries the De­vils, lies in the <span class="hi">Nature</span> of them. Tis said in <span class="hi">Zph.</span> 6. 12, <span class="hi">We fight not against flesh &amp; blood</span> only, <span class="hi">but against principalities, and Powers, and spiritual wickednesses.</span> They are <span class="hi">spiritual,</span> and therefore <span class="hi">powerful.</span> The <span class="hi">Spirituality</span> of the <span class="hi">Devils</span> enables them to strike us when we can't <span class="hi">see</span> them; <span class="gap" title="〈◊〉"> [...]</span> <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d31e8872"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=49306&amp;page=47">[Page 8]</a></span> makes 'em ready to attack us and surprise us at unspeakable Disadvantages. The <span class="hi">Divels</span> are <span class="hi">Spi­rits,</span> and hence they count <span class="hi">Iron but straw, &amp; brass as rotten wood;</span> they are <span class="hi">Spirits,</span> and so they <span class="hi">excel in strength;</span> when they seem afraid of little <span class="hi">Spels</span> and <span class="hi">Charms,</span> it is only a stratagem by which they seek to decoy us into their dreadful <span class="hi">Power</span> more than before. <span class="hi">One</span> of them let loose, perhaps could <span class="hi">slaughter</span> an Army of an hundred thousand in a night.</p><p>Secondly, The <span class="hi">Power</span> of our Adversaries the <span class="hi">De­vils,</span> lies in the <span class="hi">Number</span> of them. Even such little things as <span class="hi">Mire,</span> yea, and <span class="hi">Lice</span> have prov'd horri­ble plagues by becoming numerous. What then may the <span class="hi">Devils</span> be, whose Troops amount unto many <span class="hi">Legions:</span> How many <span class="hi">devils</span> care sometimes be spared, for the Vexation of <span class="hi">one man!</span> In the bowels of one afflicted child, I have heard that murmur made, <span class="hi">There are two or three of us!</span> Yea, we read in <span class="hi">Luc.</span> 8. 30. of a <span class="hi">Le­gion</span> that kept a <span class="hi">Garrison</span> in one single person a a <span class="hi">Legion</span> contain'd twelve <span class="hi">Thousand</span> and five <span class="hi">Hun­dred</span> in it. Doubtless, there are far more <span class="hi">Devils</span> than there are <span class="hi">Men</span> in the world. They <span class="hi">swarm</span> like the Frogs of <span class="hi">Egypt</span> in every chamber of our houses. We can go, we can stir no where, but those wild <span class="hi">Arabians</span> will be upon us.</p><p>Thirdly, The <span class="hi">Power</span> of our Adversaries the <span class="hi">Devils</span> lies in their <span class="hi">Confoederacies.</span> The <span class="hi">Devils</span> are all as <span class="hi">one</span> themselves; their Unity, <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d31e9001"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=49306&amp;page=48">[Page 9]</a></span> their <span class="hi">Agrement</span> in their designs makes them for­midable. We are told in Mat. 12. 26. <span class="hi">Satan is not divided against himself.</span> But more than so, The <span class="hi">devils</span> have of their party among <span class="hi">our selves,</span> yea, <span class="hi">within</span> our selves. Devils have <span class="hi">Men</span> on their side. All wicked <span class="hi">men</span> promote the ends of the <span class="hi">devils.</span> Tis said, <span class="hi">The lusts of the</span> devil <span class="hi">they will do;</span> 'tis said. <span class="hi">The divel works in the Children of disobe­dience.</span> And the Devils have <span class="hi">Hearts</span> on their side Our wicked <span class="hi">hearts</span> will favour and humour the <span class="hi">devils</span> in their attempts, and betray us into their hands. When they made their assault on our Saviour, tis said, <span class="hi">They found nothing in Him.</span> But they find <span class="hi">something</span> in <span class="hi">us,</span> they find in us, an <span class="hi">In­mate</span> by whose <span class="hi">Treachery</span> we become their <span class="hi">prey.</span> This is the <span class="hi">Power of the Enemy.</span></p><p><span class="hi">Prop.</span> IV. The <span class="hi">devils</span> are also <span class="hi">cruel</span> Adversa­ries of our souls. The Divel is not only a <span class="hi">Lion,</span> but a <span class="hi">roaring,</span> an hungry, an <span class="hi">angry</span> Lion. Yes, according to that in <span class="hi">Rev.</span> 20. 2. he is not only a <span class="hi">Lion,</span> but a <span class="hi">Dragon</span> too. He will have no more mercy than a Lion, he will have no more mercy than a <span class="hi">Dragon</span> upon all that comes in the way of his cruel Clutches. 'Twas the description of the <span class="hi">Chaldaeans</span> in Hab. 1. 6. <span class="hi">That bitter and hasly nation.</span> To the <span class="hi">devils</span> does it much more belong; they are a <span class="hi">Bitter and a cruel nation.</span> Never was there such a merciless and a pittiless <span class="hi">Tyrant</span> as the <span class="hi">devil</span> is, nothing so much pleases that bloody monster, as the <span class="hi">pain</span> and the <span class="hi">death</span> of our unhap­py <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d31e9138"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=49306&amp;page=48">[Page 10]</a></span> souls; and he has no Musick like the <span class="hi">groans of a deadly wounded man.</span> What a Prodigy of Cruelty was the <span class="hi">Roman</span> Emperour, who wished that <span class="hi">all his people had but one neck, that he might cut it off at a blow!</span> Why the <span class="hi">cruel Devil</span> not only <span class="hi">wished,</span> but in Paradise he <span class="hi">had</span> &amp; he <span class="hi">did</span> such an horrid thing. And it is he that inspires vile men with all the <span class="hi">Cruelty</span> that their <span class="hi">Inquisitions,</span> and their <span class="hi">Tortures</span> give exemple of.</p><p><span class="hi">Prop.</span> V. The Devils are likewise <span class="hi">Restless</span> Ad­versaries of our souls. They <span class="hi">go about,</span> they are always in <span class="hi">Action,</span> always in <span class="hi">Motion,</span> that they may undo the souls of men.</p><p>The Devil <span class="hi">goes about.</span> So could he say of himself, in Job, 1. 7. <span class="hi">I come from going to and fro in the earth, and from walking up and down in it.</span> This Prince goes in <span class="hi">Progress,</span> rides the <span class="hi">Circuit</span> thro his whole Dominions to see how his work is carried on. And all that are under the Inspe­ction of this <span class="hi">Prime Visier</span> are continually travell­ing and labouring too for the destruction of im­mortal souls. They <span class="hi">go about,</span> but <span class="hi">how?</span> We read in <span class="hi">Iude</span> 6. they are <span class="hi">kept in chains;</span> Tis by some rendered, they are kept <span class="hi">for</span> chains: but suppose them <span class="hi">in</span> chains; their chains are so <span class="hi">lengthened,</span> &amp; yet so <span class="hi">limited</span> that they <span class="hi">go about,</span> just where and when, and how far the Permission of God shall give them leave. As they are not now in all the <span class="hi">Torment,</span> so they are not now in all the <span class="hi">Bon­dage</span> intended for them.

You shall see what the Po­stures and Methods of the Devil are; they are drawn with a Pencil of the <span class="hi">Sanctuary,</span> in Psal. 10 4. <span class="hi">He lyes in wait secretly, as a</span> Lion <span class="hi">in his den he lyes in wait to catch the poor; he does catch the poor when he drawes him into his net.</span> Such a <span class="hi">devil­dish</span> Adversary have we to deal withal.</p><div class="application" id="index.xml-body.1_div.2_div.1_div.1"><h3><span class="headingNumber">2.1.1. </span><span class="head">USE.

We read of one in <span class="hi">Ezek.</span> 19. 6. <span class="hi">Who became a <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d31e9379"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=49306&amp;page=49">[Page 12]</a></span> young Lion and learned to catch the prey, &amp; devour­ed men.</span> Such Lions there often are in the world; sometimes there are men whose business, whose delight it is to <span class="hi">devour</span> their Neighbours; men who <span class="hi">go about</span> to impair the Estate, who <span class="hi">go about</span> to blemish the <span class="hi">esteem,</span> who <span class="hi">go about</span> to <span class="hi">debanch</span> the <span class="hi">souls</span> of other men.

Let us <span class="hi">get</span> from the <span class="hi">Roaring Lion,</span> by a sincere <span class="hi">Turning</span> to God in Christ. Hear &amp; quake all you that are yet in your unregenerate estate; you are in the mouth of the <span class="hi">Roaring Lion:</span> Oh, how can you be satisfyed or contented there? In <span class="hi">Conversion,</span> we are told in <span class="hi">Act.</span> 29. 18. men are turned <span class="hi">from the power of satan unto God.</span> Man, thou art under the <span class="hi">under the power of satan,</span> until thou art <span class="hi">born again.</span> O save thy self before it be <span class="hi">too late.</span> One once being ready to be devoured by a <span class="hi">Lion,</span> cry'd out, <span class="hi">Help, help, I am yet alive! held, I am yet alive!</span> O thou are <span class="hi">yet alive,</span> but <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d31e9603"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=49306&amp;page=50">[Page 14]</a></span> if thou art not quickly redeemed from the <span class="hi">Lion,</span> it will ere long be <span class="hi">All too late!

Every one has his <span class="hi">Post,</span> and his <span class="hi">Work;</span> and they are all glad of an opportunity to be <span class="hi">mischievous</span> in the World. These are they by whom <span class="hi">Witches</span> do exert their Devillish and ma­lignant Rage upon their <span class="hi">Neighbours:</span> And espe­cially Two Acts concur hereunto. The <span class="hi">First</span> is, Their <span class="hi">Covenanting</span> with the Witches. There is a most hellish <span class="hi">League</span> made between them, with va­rious <span class="hi">Rites</span> and <span class="hi">Ceremonies.</span> The <span class="hi">Witches</span> promise to serve the <span class="hi">Devils,</span> and the <span class="hi">Devils</span> promise to <span class="hi">help</span> the Witches; <span class="hi">How?</span> It is not convenient to be related. The <span class="hi">Second</span> is, Their <span class="hi">Representing</span> of the Witches. And hereby indeed these are drawn into <span class="hi">Snares</span> and <span class="hi">Cords</span> of Death. The <span class="hi">Devils,</span> when they go upon the Errands of the <span class="hi">Witches,</span> do <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d31e11184"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=49306&amp;page=57">[Page 7]</a></span> hear their <span class="hi">Names;</span> and hence do <span class="hi">Harmes</span> too come to be carried from the <span class="hi">Devils</span> to the <span class="hi">Witches.</span> We need not suppose such a wild thing as the <span class="hi">Transforming</span> of those Wretches into <span class="hi">Bruits</span> or <span class="hi">Birds,</span> as we too often do.</p><p>It should next be proved <span class="hi">THAT</span> Witch­craft <span class="hi">is.</span></p><p>The <span class="hi">Being</span> of such a thing is denied by many that place a <span class="hi">great part</span> of their <span class="hi">small wit</span> in deride­ing the Stories that are told of it. Their chief Argument is, That they never <span class="hi">saw</span> any Witches, therefore there are <span class="hi">none.</span> Just as if you or I should say, We never met with any <span class="hi">Robbers</span> on the Road, therefore there never was any <span class="hi">Padding</span> there.</p><p>Indeed the <span class="hi">Devils</span> are loath to have true No­tions of <span class="hi">Witches</span> entertained with us. I have beheld them to put out the eyes of an enchaunted Child, when a Book that proves, <span class="hi">There is Witch­craft,</span> was laid before her. But there are espe­cially Two Demonstrations that evince the Be­ing of that Infernal mysterious thing.</p><p><span class="hi">First.</span> We have the Testimony of <span class="hi">Scripture</span> for it. We find <span class="hi">Witchcrafts</span> often mentioned, sometimes by way of <span class="hi">Assertion,</span> sometimes by way of <span class="hi">Allusion,</span> in the Oracles of God. Besides that, We have there the History of diverse <span class="hi">Witches</span> in these infallible and inspired Writings Particularly, the Instance of the <span class="hi">Witch</span> at <span class="hi">Endor,</span> in 1. <span class="hi">Sam.</span> 28. 7. is so plain and full that <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d31e11294"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=49306&amp;page=58">[Page 8]</a></span> <span class="hi">Witchcraft</span> it self is not a more amazing thing than any <span class="hi">Dispute</span> about the Being of it, after this. The Advocates of <span class="hi">Witches</span> must use more <span class="hi">Tricks</span> to make Nonsense of the <span class="hi">Bible,</span> than ever the <span class="hi">Witch</span> of <span class="hi">Endor</span> used in her Magical Incantations, if they would evade the Force of that famous History.

Christian, There are <span class="hi">Devils:</span> and so many of them too, that sometimes a <span class="hi">Legion</span> of them are spar'd for the vexation of <span class="hi">one man.</span> The <span class="hi">Air</span> in which we breath is full of them. Be sensible of this, you that <span class="hi">obey God:</span> there are Troops of <span class="hi">Tempters</span> on every side of thee. <span class="hi">Awake,</span> O Soul, Awake, Those <span class="hi">Philistines</span> of Hell <span class="hi">are upon thee.</span> Upon the least affrightment in the dark, many simple people cry out, <span class="hi">The Devil! The De­vil!</span> Alas, there are <span class="hi">Devils</span> thronging about thee every day. O let the thought of it make thee a careful and a watchful man. And be sensible of this you that <span class="hi">commit Sin:</span> The Lord Jesus hath said of you, <span class="hi">Ye will do the lusts of your father the</span> De­vil. How often do many of you make a <span class="hi">Mock</span> and a <span class="hi">Ieer</span> of the Devil while you are drudging for him? But know, that there are dreadful <span class="hi">Devils</span> to seize upon thy forlorn forsaken soul, at its departure hence. O become a new man at the thought of this.</p><p>2. Since there are <span class="hi">Witches</span> and <span class="hi">Devils,</span> we may conclude that there are also <span class="hi">Immortal Souls, Devils</span> would never contract with <span class="hi">Witches</span> for their Souls if there were no such things to be­come a prey unto them. One of the <span class="hi">Popas</span> when he lay dying, said, <span class="hi">I shall now quickly know whe­ther I have an</span> Immortal Soul <span class="hi">or no.</span> Within less than a hundred years, you &amp; I shall be convinced of it, if we are not so before. We may truly <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d31e12464"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=49306&amp;page=62">[Page 17]</a></span> say, <span class="hi">Devils</span> &amp; <span class="hi">Witches</span> bear a witness against them that have any scruple of it. There are some dreaming Hereticks, that hold <span class="hi">Man wholly mortal:</span> I am sure the Apostle <span class="hi">Paul</span> was not of their <span class="hi">breast­ly</span> Opinion, when he said in <span class="hi">Phil.</span> 1. 21. <span class="hi">I de­sire to be dissolved and to be with Christ.</span> Nor was the Martyr <span class="hi">Stephen</span> of their Opinion, when he expired saying, in <span class="hi">Act.</span> 7. 59. <span class="hi">Lord Iesus Re­ceive my spirit.</span> Nor was our Lord Jesus Himself of that opinion, when He said unto Theef on the Cross in <span class="hi">Luc.</span> 23. 43. <span class="hi">This day thou shalt the with Me in Paradise.</span> 'Tis an Opinion unwor­thy of a man that is owner of a <span class="hi">Soul.</span> The mis­taken <span class="hi">Indians,</span> when first they saw a man on Horse-back, did conceit the <span class="hi">Man</span> and the <span class="hi">Horse</span> to be <span class="hi">one</span> Creature: it is as soul an Error to conceit that it is but <span class="hi">one thing</span> which man consist­eth of.

This <span class="hi">li­ving soul</span> is the <span class="hi">Candle of the Lord</span> within thee, and no Wind, no Death can ever extinguish it.

It is hardly twenty years ago, that a whole Kingdom in <span class="hi">Eu­rope</span> was alarum'd by such potent <span class="hi">Witchcrafts;</span> that some hundreds of poor Children were inva­ded with them. Persons of great <span class="hi">Honour</span> have sometimes been cruelly <span class="hi">bewitched.</span> What lately besell a worthy <span class="hi">Knight</span> in <span class="hi">Scotland,</span> is well known unto the world. Persons of great <span class="hi">Vertue</span> too, have been bewitched, even into their Graves. But Four years are passed since a holy man was kill'd in this doleful way, after the <span class="hi">Ioy</span> as well as the <span class="hi">Grace</span> of GOD had been wonderfully fill­ing of him. This Consideration should keep us from <span class="hi">censuring</span> of those that <span class="hi">Witchcraft</span> may give Disturbance to: but it should put us on <span class="hi">study­ing</span> of our own security. <span class="hi">Suppose ye</span> that the <span class="hi">en­chanted Family</span> in the Town, were sinners above all <span class="hi">the Town,</span> because they have suffered such things I tell ye Nay, but except ye repent, ye may <span class="hi">all</span> be so dealt withall.

No less than <span class="hi">Death,</span> and that a languishing and a terrible <span class="hi">Death</span> will satisfie the Rage of those sormidable Dragons. Indeed <span class="hi">Witchcraft</span> sometimes growes up into <span class="hi">Pos­session</span> it self: the Devils that are permitted to <span class="hi">torment,</span> at last do possess the <span class="hi">Bodies</span> of the <span class="hi">be­witched sufferers.</span> But who can bear the thoughts of that! who can forbear crying out, <span class="hi">O Lord, my flesh trembles for fear of Thee, and I am afraid of Thy Iudgements.</span></p><p>What shall then be done for our <span class="hi">Preservati­on?</span> Away with all <span class="hi">superstitious.</span> Preservatives; about <span class="hi">those</span> Confidences the Word of God is that in <span class="hi">Ier.</span> 2. 37. <span class="hi">Thou shalt not prosper in them.</span></p><p>But there are Three admirable <span class="hi">Amalets</span> that <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d31e12811"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=49306&amp;page=64">[Page 20]</a></span> I can heartily recommend unto you all.</p><p>The First Preservative is, <span class="hi">A fervent</span> PRAYER.

This is the Witchcraft of them that with <span class="hi">Glasses</span> and <span class="hi">Basons</span> will go to discover how they shall be <span class="hi">Related</span> be­fore they dy. They are a sort of <span class="hi">Witches</span> that thus employ themselves. And this is the Witch­craft of the <span class="hi">Iudicial Astrologer.</span> That Astro­loger is a Cousin-German to a <span class="hi">Conjurer.</span> I think I know his Rules, and I am satisfied that his <span class="hi">Iudgment</span> must at last be determined by his <span class="hi">Im­pulse,</span> or it is not worth an hundredth part of what the silly Enquirer payes him for it: and from <span class="hi">whom,</span> from <span class="hi">what</span> shall that Impulse <span class="hi">come?</span> Behold the Energy of <span class="hi">Devils</span> in it. It is like­wise a sort of <span class="hi">Sorcery,</span> for persons to let their <span class="hi">Bibles fall open,</span> on purpose to determine what the state of their <span class="hi">souls</span> is, from the first <span class="hi">word</span> they light upon. And some among us, they say, are so extremely sinful, as to consult one whom they count a <span class="hi">Conjurer,</span> when they would under­stand what they know not otherwise. 'Tis hor­rible, that in this <span class="hi">Land of Vprightness</span> there should be any such <span class="hi">Prank of wickedness.</span> I do earnestly <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d31e13738"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=49306&amp;page=68">[Page 28]</a></span> testifie unto you that these things are <span class="hi">abominables</span> the voice of our God is, <span class="hi">O do them not, my soul hates them.</span> I do warn and charge you, Shun these execrable things, lest you he left unto the furthest Witchcraft committed by the <span class="hi">abhorted of the Lord.</span></p><p>2. Take heed that you do not <span class="hi">wrongfully ac­cuse</span> any other person, of this horrid and mon­strous evil. It is the Character of a Godly man, in <span class="hi">Psal.</span> 15. 3. He taketh not up a <span class="hi">Reproach</span> a­gainst his Neighbour. What more dirty <span class="hi">Reproach</span> than that of <span class="hi">Witchcraft</span> can there be? Yet it is most readily dast upon <span class="hi">worthy</span> persons, when their is hardly a shadow of any reason for it. An <span class="hi">Ill-look,</span> or a <span class="hi">cross word</span> will make a Witch with many people who may on more ground be coun­ted so themselves. There has been a fearful deal of Injury done in <span class="hi">this way</span> in <span class="hi">this Town,</span> to the <span class="hi">Good-name</span> of the most credible persons in it. Persons of more Goodness and Esteem than any of their calumnious Abusers have been defamed for <span class="hi">Witches</span> about this Countrey, <span class="hi">A Countrey full of lyes.</span> I beseech you, Let all <span class="hi">Back-biting,</span> and all <span class="hi">Evil-surmising</span> be put away from among you: do not, on small grounds <span class="hi">Fly-blow</span> the <span class="hi">pre­cious ointment</span> of the <span class="hi">good-name</span> that thy Neigh­bour should have.

Alas, thou might'st with as much Honesty break open the House, or take away the purse of thy Neigh­bour: His <span class="hi">Good Name</span> is of more Account.

All that leave the <span class="hi">way e­verlasting,</span> and take a <span class="hi">way of wickedness,</span> they are <span class="hi">bewitched;</span> a grievous <span class="hi">Witchcraft</span> has siez'd upon them. The Apostle said to some in <span class="hi">Gal.</span> 3. 1. O foolish <span class="hi">Galatians,</span> who hath <span class="hi">bewitched</span> you, that you should not obey the Truth? This may be an Expo­stulation us'd with all ungodly men; O foolish Transgressors, who has <span class="hi">bewitched</span> you? I'le tell you <span class="hi">who:</span> Not an <span class="hi">Hog,</span> but a <span class="hi">Lust</span> has bewitched 'em. They that are bewitched, have a marvellous va­riety of calamity upon them. One while they can't <span class="hi">see;</span> that is <span class="hi">thy</span> case; <span class="hi">Thou</span> art wretched, but thou canst not <span class="hi">see</span> it; Christ is lovely, but thou canst not <span class="hi">see</span> him. One while they cannot <span class="hi">hear;</span> that is <span class="hi">thy</span> case; God calls, <span class="hi">Look unto me and be saved;</span> but thou <span class="hi">hearest</span> nothing of it. A­nother while they can't <span class="hi">stirr;</span> that is <span class="hi">thy</span> case; The Lord Jesus calls, <span class="hi">Come unto me,</span> but thou <span class="hi">movest</span> not. Sometimes they are as it were, <span class="hi">cut,</span> &amp; <span class="hi">prick't,</span> and <span class="hi">distorted</span> in their Limbs; the very same art thou in all the <span class="hi">Faculties</span> of thy soul. At <span class="hi">othertimes</span> they are pulled into the <span class="hi">Fire,</span> or into the <span class="hi">Water,</span> or thrown with violence upon the <span class="hi">Ground;</span> the like happens to thy unhappy soul; it is hur­ried thither, where the <span class="hi">sire is not quenched;</span> it is hurried thither where they <span class="hi">groan under, the wa­ters;</span> it is also made to <span class="hi">pant after the dust of the earth.</span> The <span class="hi">Drunken</span> man is <span class="hi">bewitched</span> with strong Drink; the <span class="hi">unclean</span> man is <span class="hi">bewitch't</span> with strange <span class="hi">Flesh;</span> the tongue of a <span class="hi">Swearer</span> is acted worse <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d31e14556"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=49306&amp;page=71">[Page 35]</a></span> than the tongue of a <span class="hi">bewitch't</span> man; the <span class="hi">covetous</span> man is hideously <span class="hi">bewitched</span> with <span class="hi">Bags</span> &amp; <span class="hi">Lands.</span></p><p>O pity thine own soul; and <span class="hi">give no sleep to thine eyes nor slumber to thine eye lids,</span> until thine immortal soul be deliver'd from thy <span class="hi">natural state.</span> Let not <span class="hi">VVitchcraft</span> it felf be a more frightful thing to thee, than thy own present Unregene­neracy. Turn ye, turn ye, why <span class="hi">will</span> ye dye?</p><p>Secondly. Let not an Act of <span class="hi">Rebellion</span> be allowed by us. When <span class="hi">Ioseph</span> was incited unto an <span class="hi">Ill Act,</span> he said, in <span class="hi">Gen,</span> 39. 9. <span class="hi">How shall I do this</span> wicked­ness <span class="hi">and sin against God?</span> Thus, when we are urged unto any <span class="hi">Ill Act,</span> Let us refuse it so, <span class="hi">No, this is like</span> Wicthcraft, <span class="hi">shall I by such</span> wickedness <span class="hi">make my self as a</span> Witch <span class="hi">before the Lord?</span></p><p>Three Things are to be Recommend here</p><p>First, <span class="hi">Arm</span> yourselves against all the <span class="hi">Devices,</span> with which the <span class="hi">Devils</span> would hook you into any <span class="hi">Rebellion</span> against the Lord. For Rebellion against <span class="hi">God,</span> there will be that clause in our <span class="hi">Indictment.</span> They <span class="hi">were moved by the Instigation of the</span> Devil. Now furnish yourselves with <span class="hi">Armour</span> to keep off the Dint of the <span class="hi">Devils Instigations;</span> in short, <span class="hi">put on the whole Armour of God.</span> There is specially a <span class="hi">double Care</span> that will be of great use in your En­counters.</p><p>First. Use your <span class="hi">Watch</span> well. We read in <span class="hi">Eph.</span> 6. 11. about the <span class="hi">Wiles</span> of the <span class="hi">Devil.</span> When the De­vil would engage us in a <span class="hi">Rebellion,</span> there are cer­tain <span class="hi">Wily Methods</span> by which he doth accomplish <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d31e14694"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=49306&amp;page=72">[Page 36]</a></span> it. He works more by <span class="hi">Fraud</span> then by <span class="hi">Forts;</span> and there is a <span class="hi">cryptic method</span> by which he doth gain us over to himself. A crafty Sophister has a <span class="hi">three-fold Method,</span> with which he prevails upon his Auditors; and such the Method of the <span class="hi">Devil</span> is. <span class="hi">Watch,</span> First against the <span class="hi">Deficient</span> method of the Devil. The Devil will show us the Sin <span class="hi">without</span> the <span class="hi">Curse,</span> the Bait <span class="hi">without</span> the <span class="hi">Hook:</span> So he saies <span class="hi">Eat the pleasant Fruit:</span> but he saies not, Thou shalt <span class="hi">dye</span> if thou do it. The Devil will re­present unto us the <span class="hi">Difficulty</span> of a Duty, but <span class="hi">con­ceal</span> the <span class="hi">recompence</span> of it. So he says, <span class="hi">It's a hard thing to pray</span> in <span class="hi">secret every day;</span> but he says not, Thy Fa­ther will <span class="hi">Reward</span> thee. And he will represent un­to us the <span class="hi">Excuse</span> of a Sin, but <span class="hi">conceal</span> the <span class="hi">Ill shape</span> of it: So he saies, <span class="hi">Many others have done this and that;</span> but he saies not, <span class="hi">God was</span> provoked at it. These are Tricks to be <span class="hi">watched</span> against.</p><p><span class="hi">Watch,</span> Secondly, against the <span class="hi">Redundant</span> Method of the Devil. Sometimes the devil will use a <span class="hi">Di­gression.</span> He will seem to give over his <span class="hi">Intent</span> in one thing, but make sure of his Intent in another. Such a Stratagem he uses as what <span class="hi">Ioshua</span> took <span class="hi">A<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span></span> withal; he <span class="hi">retires,</span> and so he <span class="hi">conquers.</span> He will make <span class="hi">Haughtiness</span> and <span class="hi">Security</span> undo the soul, that he could not make of his party for <span class="hi">grosser Wicked­ness.</span> Sometimes the devil will use a <span class="hi">Commoration.</span> He will dog a man, and bring Perswasion upon perswasion, as <span class="hi">Delilah</span> did with <span class="hi">Sampson;</span> and <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d31e14839"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=49306&amp;page=72">[Page 37]</a></span> like a cnuning <span class="hi">Fencer,</span> he <span class="hi">repeats</span> blow after blow, till he smite home. These are Dangers to be <span class="hi">Watched</span> against.</p><p><span class="hi">Watch,</span> Thirdly, against the <span class="hi">Inverting</span> Method of the Devil. One while the Devil will endeav­our to carry us on from <span class="hi">Lesser</span> sins to <span class="hi">Greater</span> sins. He will go to make our miscarriages like <span class="hi">Elijah'</span>s cloud; at first as an <span class="hi">Hands-breadth,</span> but anon so as to hide the whole <span class="hi">Heaven</span> from us. So <span class="hi">Solomon</span> multiplies first <span class="hi">Horses,</span> &amp; afterward <span class="hi">worse</span> things against the command of God. Another while, the Devil will decoy us from <span class="hi">lawful</span> things to <span class="hi">un</span>lawful things. Thus from a <span class="hi">Good-husband,</span> a man shall grow a meer <span class="hi">Muck-worm.</span> Now and then also, the Devil will try to spoil <span class="hi">Good works</span> with <span class="hi">Ill ends:</span> Thus the <span class="hi">Pride</span> of <span class="hi">Iebu</span> shall be swell'd by the <span class="hi">Zeal</span> of <span class="hi">Iebu.</span> He will try to make our Duties <span class="hi">Interfere;</span> the <span class="hi">general Calling</span> shall be regarded in the season of the <span class="hi">particular,</span> and the <span class="hi">particular calling</span> shall be attended in the season of the <span class="hi">general.</span> He will try to lead us from one <span class="hi">Ex­treme</span> to another; We shall be excessively <span class="hi">merry,</span> and ere long excessively <span class="hi">melancholly,</span> if we hearken to him. O keep up your <span class="hi">Watch.</span> Well did the Apostle say, in 1. <span class="hi">Pet.</span> 5. 8. Be <span class="hi">vigilant,</span> for the <span class="hi">Devil</span> as a roaring lion, seeketh whom he may devour.</p><p>Secondly. Use your <span class="hi">Sword</span> well. Tis said in <span class="hi">Eph.</span> 6. 17. Take the <span class="hi">Sword</span> of the Spirit which is the <span class="hi">Word</span> of God. The Devil cannot stand be­fore the Brandishings of this <span class="hi">Two-edged Sword.</span> <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d31e14978"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=49306&amp;page=73">[Page 38]</a></span> Our Saviour overcame the devil by making that Return, <span class="hi">It is written,</span> and <span class="hi">It is written,</span> against all his lewd attempts. Would he get you into any <span class="hi">Rebellion?</span> One <span class="hi">Text</span> well managed will make him fly before you. Would he have you be <span class="hi">unjust?</span> Then answer, It is written, The <span class="hi">inrighteous</span> shall not inherit the kingdom of God.

Beware of <span class="hi">that</span> Rebellion against God particularly, which the <span class="hi">Devils</span> are <span class="hi">most</span> gratified withal. It is said in <span class="hi">Eph.</span> 4. 40. <span class="hi">Grieve not the holy Spirit of God.</span> The <span class="hi">unclean devils</span> are pleased most with such things as that <span class="hi">Holy Spirit</span> is most <span class="hi">grieved</span> with. Sometimes the Devils have been forced as it were, to discover their own <span class="hi">Inclinati­ons:</span> thro the mouths of <span class="hi">possessed</span> persons, they have declar'd what was very grateful to them. The Children that have lately been under a <span class="hi">dia­bolical Fascination</span> in this Town, have given us diverse Intimations, which we might make use­ful Observations on. I observed, that tho they had much <span class="hi">delight in prayer</span> when they were <span class="hi">well;</span> yet when they were <span class="hi">ill,</span> they could not endure it. The <span class="hi">Damons</span> would make them sing, &amp; roar, and <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d31e15074"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=49306&amp;page=73">[Page 39]</a></span> stop their ears, and plague them, and at last lay them for <span class="hi">dead,</span> if any prayer were in the Room. Whence it may be inferred, That you who can go without <span class="hi">Prayer</span> from day to day, do just as the <span class="hi">Devils</span> would have you. The Devils have an horrible <span class="hi">Rendezvous</span> in that <span class="hi">Family,</span> in that <span class="hi">Closet,</span> where <span class="hi">Prayer</span> is not maintained. I observed, that tho the <span class="hi">Word of God</span> were their Companion &amp; <span class="hi">Counsellor</span> at other times, yet <span class="hi">now</span> they would fall into <span class="hi">Convulsions,</span> if one did but look into a <span class="hi">Bible.</span> Whence it may be suppos'd that you who <span class="hi">read</span> not the <span class="hi">Scripture,</span> for the most part every day, do humour the <span class="hi">devils</span> in it. The <span class="hi">Devils</span> are glad to see the <span class="hi">Bibles</span> that have <span class="hi">dust</span> upon them. I observed, that <span class="hi">Haeretical,</span> or <span class="hi">Superstitious</span> or <span class="hi">pro­fane</span> Books, might be perused by some of them, when <span class="hi">serious</span> &amp; <span class="hi">Orthodox</span> Books would <span class="hi">put out their Eyes.</span> Whence it may be suggested, That you who converse much with <span class="hi">ill</span> books, do as the <span class="hi">de­vils</span> would: The Devils would willingly be where <span class="hi">Iest-books,</span> &amp; <span class="hi">Play-books,</span> &amp; <span class="hi">Romances,</span> and <span class="hi">Haeresies</span> or <span class="hi">Superstitions</span> are made a Library. I observed, that tho they were exemplary for <span class="hi">Ho­nesty</span> &amp; <span class="hi">Sobriety,</span> yet now their Wishes to <span class="hi">steal</span> &amp; <span class="hi">be drunk,</span> were frequently expressed; and some­times they were made very <span class="hi">drunk</span> tho no intox­icating <span class="hi">Drink</span> had bin in the least an occasion of it. Whence it may be gathered, That the <span class="hi">Drunk­ard</span> has a <span class="hi">devil</span> in him, the <span class="hi">Stealer</span> has a <span class="hi">devil</span> in him. The Devils have sport enough, when they <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d31e15219"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=49306&amp;page=74">[Page 40]</a></span> see a man Reeling in the streets; the <span class="hi">divels</span> are the Comrades of them that go to <span class="hi">take what is none of their own.</span> I observed, That tho <span class="hi">few</span> in the place were so <span class="hi">diligent</span> as <span class="hi">they,</span> nevertheless in their <span class="hi">Fits</span> they might not do any <span class="hi">work</span> at all. Whence it may be concluded, That of <span class="hi">Idleness comes no good­ness.</span> The <span class="hi">devils</span> are the <span class="hi">Play-mates</span> of them that are <span class="hi">Gaming</span> when they should be <span class="hi">working.</span> An <span class="hi">i­dle</span> person is a <span class="hi">Prentice</span> of a <span class="hi">divel.</span> These things have been <span class="hi">observed;</span> and now let these <span class="hi">Vices</span> be <span class="hi">avoided.</span> There is <span class="hi">Witchcraft</span> in them.</p><p>O that the <span class="hi">Divels</span> might be <span class="hi">out-shot in their own Bow,</span> and that these <span class="hi">Vices</span> might be made odious by their Affection for them.</p><p>Thirdly.

Why, our Animadvertor tells us, <span class="hi">I.

Reader, you shall find my Fathers intro­duction to his Histories to be, <span class="hi">All wise men that are acquainted therewith, observe the blasting re­bukes of Heaven upon the late SINGING and Dancing Quakers.</span> And his Inference from them is, That <span class="hi">The Quakers are</span> SOME <span class="hi">of them undoubtedly possessed with evil spirits;</span> and his Conclusion is, <span class="hi">We may, by this, judge whose servants the</span> Singing <span class="hi">Quakers are.</span> Behold how carefully he has Repeated the very <span class="hi">Distinction</span> which this waspish man complains at the O­mission of!

My Father to Vindicate himself, while our old Government yet lasted, wrote a Letter to Mr. <span class="hi">Dudley,</span> who had from <span class="hi">White-Hall,</span> Re­ceived a Copy of that bloody Forgery; and in this Vindication, he intimates that several shrowd things would make him suspect <span class="hi">Randolph</span> himself to be the Director of it. It was Evi­dent unto him That the whole Forgery was con­trived for <span class="hi">Randolph</span>'s advantage; tis almost all of him and <span class="hi">for</span> him; but could any rational man imagine, that <span class="hi">he</span> was then wholly a stranger <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d31e16243"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=49306&amp;page=80">[Page 10]</a></span> to it? Besides there were in it several other Expressions, which (twas then thought) no man in his <span class="hi">Wits</span> can dream that any without <span class="hi"><span class="unclear">him[?]</span></span> should have. But <span class="hi">Randolph</span> upon his arrival here with our New Government getting a Co­py of my Fathers Vindication, dos after so ma­ny months now sue him in an <span class="hi">Action of Defa­mation,</span> to Embarass the Affairs he had before him. The Jury which consisted partly of Church of <span class="hi">E.</span> Gentlemen, <span class="hi">Found for</span> my Father against the Plaintiffe. And yet just within a Week or two before his Voyage, <span class="hi">Randolph</span> renewed his Action; his Abetters resolving (as I am credi­bly informed) That having laid the Arrest up­on him, they would have secur'd his Person in the Goal, as the worse of Traytors; for what <span class="hi">Illegality</span> would they stick at? He happily under­standing, what they would be <span class="hi">at,</span> by the coun­sel of his Friends withdrew, for about a week; and then, tho both by Day and Night, both by <span class="hi">Land</span> and <span class="hi">Sea,</span> the late <span class="hi">Spirits</span> among us way-laid him, God carried him safely thro them all; and when he came to <span class="hi">Whitehall,</span> what Favours the Greatest Men in the Kingdom have heap'd upon him, 'tis not proper for <span class="hi">me</span> to tell. Whereas our Caviller now says, <span class="hi">It wants to be insert in his Book, that what hath befallen him of late, is a Re­markable Iudgment of God upon him, for his Inju­stice to the Quakers.</span> I join issue with him, and beg the Reader to <span class="hi">insert</span> it, if he be owner of <span class="additions" id="index.xml-pb-d31e16318"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=49306&amp;page=80">[Page 11]</a></span> that harmless Book <span class="hi">Reader,</span> inasmuch as none of <span class="hi">Increase Mathers</span> enemies were <span class="hi">able</span> to <span class="hi">attain</span> their ends upon him; and inasmuch as this <span class="hi">Increase Mather</span> has in his whole Negotiation for <span class="hi">New-England,</span> been favoured by the merciful God, beyond the imagination of our fondest hopes; pray count it, <span class="hi">A Remarkable Iudgment of God upon him, for his Injustice to the Quakers.</span> This <span class="hi">G.

One while his <span class="hi">False-Histories</span> misrepresent us to the world; and he raises dismal <span class="hi">Tragedies</span> upon the Persecution which his Friends here have met withal. For my own part, I have long wished; That the <span class="hi">Ci­vil Magistrate</span> would never inflict a <span class="hi">Civil Penal­ty,</span> on an <span class="hi">Heretick,</span> until <span class="hi">Humane Society</span> receive such a Disturbance from him, as in one of mine, or any other perswasion were <span class="hi">Intollerable.</span> Yet there is more, far more to be said for the Justi­fication <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d31e16425"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=49306&amp;page=81">[Page 12]</a></span> of our ancient <span class="hi">Severities</span> on two or three <span class="hi">Quakers</span> here, than the world has yet been ac­quainted with. <span class="hi">Oliver Cromwel</span> himself, whose <span class="hi">Toleration</span> of <span class="hi">Sectaries</span> was notorious euough, yet would speak in the justification of what was here done to <span class="hi">them.</span> Since our <span class="hi">Ierusalem</span> was come to such a Consistence, that the <span class="hi">going up of every Fox</span> would not <span class="hi">break down our stone wall,</span> who ever meddled with 'em? And since <span class="hi">That,</span> Though a Quaker-woman came (as sometimes they have) stark naked, into some of our Solemn <span class="hi">Assemblies,</span> declaring her self to be a <span class="hi">Sign;</span> yet the <span class="hi">Bruit</span> has not been thought fit to be <span class="hi">Hang'd up:</span> but the Generality of the people are enough, &amp; alwaies <span class="hi">were,</span> averse to the inflicting of Saecular Punishments on these doting <span class="hi">Haereticks.</span> Indeed a <span class="hi">Grave Magistrate</span> once (tis said) propounded unto the <span class="hi">General Court</span> at <span class="hi">Plimouth,</span> a Law that every <span class="hi">Quaker might have his head shaved;</span> because they were distracted, &amp; this would both <span class="hi">shame</span> &amp; <span class="hi">cure</span> them. I believe this is all the <span class="hi">Law</span> that ever will be offered for the Suppressing of them here; by long experience, we find, <span class="hi">They perish by being let alone.</span> But whereas, he twits the Ministers here, for their Accepting of <span class="hi">Maintenance,</span> with <span class="hi">goods unjustly taken from the true owners;</span> I may in­form the world, the Ministers here are of ano­ther Spirit than so; their voluntary <span class="hi">Poverty</span> and transcendent <span class="hi">Self-Denial,</span> has scarce its parallel in the Christian world. If any <span class="hi">maintenance</span> extort­ed <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d31e16527"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=49306&amp;page=81">[Page 13]</a></span> from <span class="hi">Quakers</span> hath ever been paid unto them, I am confident it was without their <span class="hi">knowledge</span> or <span class="hi">consent.</span> The chief Complaints of this kind are in <span class="hi">Plimouth</span> Colony; but let the Reader consider, That the <span class="hi">Grants of Lands</span> there made by the <span class="hi">Court,</span> have still been with an <span class="hi">Express Condition</span> &amp; <span class="hi">Provi­so,</span> that the allowed Ministry be therewith sup­ported. <span class="hi">Quakers</span> come and Accept &amp; Improve these Grants, and then refuse the Duty annexed thereunto.
