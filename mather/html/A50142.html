The blessed <span class="hi">Suitableness</span> of this <span class="hi">miraculous Book</span> unto the Affayrs and Concerns of all men, is, to be found (as the Philosopher saith, of the <span class="hi">Soul in the Body)</span> in <span class="hi">every part</span> thereof; but the Book of <span class="hi">Psalms</span> (a <span class="hi">Little Bible,</span> as <span class="hi">Luther</span> styl'd it) in pecu­liarwise, is so remarkable on this score, that it was no imprudence in old <span class="hi">Ierom</span> to bid his Friend make This his <span class="hi">Vade mecum,</span> his constant Companion, it was no folly in the holy Mi­nister of <span class="hi">Constantinople</span> being driven out of that City, to take no part of his Treasures but This, which was unto him <span class="hi">pro et prae Divitiis,</span> instead of and better than all the <span class="hi">Riches</span> of the World; the renouned <span class="hi">Basil</span> therefore very rightly recommended it as <span class="hi">A Divine Treasure,</span> and the eloquent <span class="hi">Chrysostom</span> no less appositely reputed it as, a <span class="hi">Panoply for the Christian.</span> From this <span class="hi">Panoply,</span> from this well-furnished <span class="hi">Armory,</span> give me leave to offer something for the Use of this <span class="hi">Armed,</span> and much honoured Auditory. For this cause the name which the Holy Spi­rit <span class="hi">in a certain place</span> (in <span class="hi">Col</span> 3. 16.) putteth upon these <span class="hi">Psalms</span> is that of <span class="hi">spiritual Songs;</span> <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d31e760"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=31811&amp;page=7">[Page 3]</a></span> partly because the <span class="hi">Spirits</span> of men are most sin­gularly <span class="hi">suited</span> therein: every man may con­ceive, as <span class="hi">Athanasius</span> long ago observed, That they speak <span class="hi">de se, in re sua,</span> to his <span class="hi">own case</span> directly.

Hence this Hundred-and-forty-fourth Psalm, with the rest unto the <span class="hi">end</span> of our Psalter, is employ'd in that business which we expect at the <span class="hi">end</span> of our pilgrimage to be put upon; even <span class="hi">The magnify­ing of the LORD IEHOVAH.</span> The <span class="hi">P<span class="gap" title="•…"> [...]</span>nman</span> of this Composure, is by the <span class="hi">Title</span> of it, deter­mined to be <span class="hi">David,</span> the <span class="hi">sweet singer of Israel.</span> Indeed some passages of it are by <span class="hi">Him</span> again repeated in both his first and his second Edi­tion of the <span class="hi">Eighteenth Psalm;</span> and if the Pri­mitive Christians in their Publique Worship, are reported to have had no common satis­faction when they heard <span class="hi">Aliquid Davidicum,</span> any thing of <span class="hi">David,</span> sounded among them, tis <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d31e853"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=31811&amp;page=8">[Page 4]</a></span> to be suppos'd, that we shall not therein come behind them.

But good old <span class="hi">Hilary</span> for one, justly and honestly declames against the foist­ing in of this clause, where it should not be. Thus much then is all the <span class="hi">Conjecture</span> for which we have room left unto us: We may ap­prehend that the amiable <span class="hi">David</span> was now ar­rived thro an <span class="hi">Iliad</span> of Mischiefs and whole Seas of Difficulties, unto a Settlement in his Kingdom over <span class="hi">Israel;</span> and that hereupon he now presents unto the Lord, both his <span class="hi">Praises</span> for the Vanquishent of the Enemies who had hitherto disquieted him, and his <span class="hi">Prayers</span> for the Continuance of his Tranquillity, maugre all future Opposition.</p><p>The Rapturous <span class="hi">Thanksgivings</span> of the Psal­Psalmist <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d31e949"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=31811&amp;page=8">[Page 5]</a></span> begin as soon as was possible; even at the verse now before us. The <span class="hi">gracious Saint</span> is here uttering of his Wishes that the great GOD may forever be well-spoken of by all the world, and this on a double account. Something God hath <span class="hi">been</span> to him, and some­thing God had <span class="hi">done</span> for him.</p><p>Firstly, For Something that God <span class="hi">was</span> to him. He ascribes to the Lord that Title, <span class="hi">my Strength,</span> or (Heb. <span class="hi">Tzuri) my Rock.</span> <span class="q">‘q. d. The Almighty God has afforded a better <span class="hi">Defence</span> to me in all dangers than the ragged <span class="hi">Rocks</span> and Caves and Thickets did unto my poor Countrey men, before I by slaying the <span class="hi">tall Pagan</span> occasion'd the Routing of the <span class="hi">Phi­listines,</span> who had driven them thereinto.’</span></p><p>Nextly, For something that God <span class="hi">did</span> for him.

The Good man first declares the <span class="hi">Subject</span> which <span class="hi">received</span> this Teaching: This was his <span class="hi">Hands</span> &amp; his <span class="hi">Fingers.</span> These are by a <span class="hi">Synecd<span class="gap" title="•…"> [...]</span>che</span> put for not only all the <span class="hi">Members</span> of his body, but also all the <span class="hi">Pow­ers</span> of his mind. These may be singled out, because there is a <span class="hi">special Use</span> of these parts in all warly Encounters. There was so parti­cularly, first in <span class="hi">Choosing</span> and then in <span class="hi">Casting</span> the <span class="hi">Stone</span> which laid the <span class="hi">Philistean</span> Champi­on sprawling on the ground.
