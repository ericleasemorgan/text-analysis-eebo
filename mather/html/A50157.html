And what have we to say, why we should not undergo it as well as they! Was the <span class="hi">Infant</span> whose Decease we do deplore, one that was very <span class="hi">Pretty,</span> one that had pretty <span class="hi">Features,</span> pretty <span class="hi">Speeches,</span> pretty <span class="hi">Actions?</span> Well, at the <span class="hi">Resurrection of the Iust</span> we shall see the dear Lambs again; the Lord Jesus will deal with our <span class="hi">dead Children</span> as the Prophets▪ <span class="hi">Elijah</span> and <span class="hi">Elisha</span> did by those whom they <span class="hi">Raised</span> of Old; he will bring them to us, recovered from the pale Jaws of Death; and how <span class="hi">Amiable,</span> how <span class="hi">Beautiful,</span> how <span class="hi">Comely</span> they will then be, no Tongue is able to express, or Heart conceive. Tho' their <span class="hi">Beauty do Con­sume in the Grave,</span> yet it shall be <span class="hi">Restored,</span> it shall be <span class="hi">Advanced,</span> when they shall put off their <span class="hi">Bed-cloths</span> in the <span class="hi">Morning</span> of the day of God. Again, Was the <span class="hi">Infant</span> now lamented, very <span class="hi">suddenly</span> snatch'd away? and perhaps <span class="hi">Awfully</span> too! not meerly by a <span class="hi">Convulsion,</span> but by <span class="hi">Scalding,</span> by <span class="hi">Burning,</span> by <span class="hi">Drowning,</span> by <span class="hi">Shooting,</span> by <span class="hi">Stabbing,</span> or by some unusual Harm? Truly, it is often <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d31e4688"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=36303&amp;page=29">[Page 51]</a></span> so, that the <span class="hi">quicker</span> the Death, the <span class="hi">better.</span> It is more desirable for our Children to feel but a few <span class="hi">Minutes</span> of Pain, than it is for them to lye Groaning in those exqui­site Agonies which would cause us even <span class="hi">our selves</span> to wish that the Lord would take them out of their Misery. As for any more grievous and signal circumstance attending of our <span class="hi">Dying Children,</span> our best course will be to have it said of us, <span class="hi">They ceased, saying, The Will of the Lord be done!</span> As the <span class="hi">Love</span> or <span class="hi">Wrath</span> of God is not certainly declared in, so, our <span class="hi">Grief</span> before him should not be too much aug­mented by such things as these. And it is a favour, if so much as one of our <span class="hi">Children</span> be left alive unto us. Let not the sense of <span class="hi">one Trouble</span> swallow up the sense of a <span class="hi">Thousand Mercies.</span> The Mother from whom a <span class="hi">violent Death</span> has taken one of her two Children, may immediately Embrace the other and say, <span class="hi">Blessed be God that has left me this!</span> But once more, Is the gone <span class="hi">Infant</span> an <span class="hi">only Child?</span> Are we now ready to sigh, <span class="hi">All is gone!</span> Nay, Thou hast but a poor <span class="hi">All,</span> if this were <span class="hi">All.</span> I hope, thy <span class="hi">only Child</span> is not thy <span class="hi">only Ioy.</span> If thou hast ever passed through the New Birth, the sense of thy Soul is, <span class="hi">One Iesus <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d31e4763"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=36303&amp;page=30">[Page 52]</a></span> is worth Ten Children; yea, One Christ is worth Ten Worlds.</span> What tho' all thy Candles are put out! The <span class="hi">Sun,</span> the <span class="hi">Sun of Righteousness</span> is arising to thy Soul for ever. An undone Man art thou indeed! that hast thy little Glass of Water spil'd or spoil'd, while thou hast a <span class="hi">Fountain,</span> a Living Fountain running by thy Door! The blessed God calls thee, <span class="hi">My Child;</span> and that is infinitely better than, <span class="hi">A Name of Sons and of Daughters.</span></p><p>Finally, Have we any Doubts about the <span class="hi">Eternal Salvation</span> of the Children which we <span class="hi">have Bur<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>ed out of our sight?</span> Indeed, as to <span class="hi">grown Children,</span> there is often too sad cause of suspicion or so­licitude; and yet here, the <span class="hi">Soveraign dis­posals</span> of God must be submitted unto. Besides, Thô it may be, <span class="hi">we</span> could not see such plain <span class="hi">Marks</span> and <span class="hi">Signs</span> of Grace in our <span class="hi">Adult Children</span> as we could have wished for, nevertheless <span class="hi">they</span> might have <span class="hi">the Root of the matter</span> in them. There are many Serious, Gracious, Well-inclined young People, who conceal from every body, the Evidences of their <span class="hi">Repentance,</span> the Instances of their <span class="hi">Devotion.</span> You can­not tell what the Lord did for the <span class="hi">Souls</span> of your poor Children before he took <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d31e4835"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=36303&amp;page=30">[Page 53]</a></span> them out of the World. Perhaps they <span class="hi">sought,</span> they <span class="hi">found</span> Mercy, <span class="hi">between the Stir­rup and the Ground.</span> The Child of a God­ly Parent, is not to be despaired of, thô <span class="hi">turned off the Gallows.</span></p><p>But as to <span class="hi">young Children,</span> the Fear of God will take away all matter of Scruple in the Owners of them. <span class="hi">Parents,</span> Can you not sincerely say, That you have given, as <span class="hi">your selves,</span> so <span class="hi">your Children,</span> unto God in a <span class="hi">Covenant never to be for­gotten?</span> Can you not sincerely say, That you have chosen God in Christ for the <span class="hi">Best Portion,</span> as of <span class="hi">your selves,</span> so of your <span class="hi">Children?</span> Answer to this: If your <span class="hi">Chil­dren</span> had been spar'd unto you, would it not have been your care to have brought them up in the <span class="hi">Nurture and Ad­monition of the Lord?</span> Would you not have used all Prayers and Pains to have engaged them unto the Service of the <span class="hi">Living God,</span> and unto a just prejudice against all the vile Idols and vain cour­ses of the World? Then, be of good cheer: Your <span class="hi">Children</span> are in a better <span class="hi">place,</span> a better <span class="hi">state,</span> than you your selves are yet arriv'd unto. The Faithful God had promised, <span class="hi">I will be their God, as well as thy God.</span> O say, <span class="hi">This is all my Desire, <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d31e4913"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=36303&amp;page=31">[Page 54]</a></span> thô the Lord suffer not my House to grow.</span> Those dear <span class="hi">Children</span> are gone from your kind Arms into the sweet Bosom of Je­sus, and this is, <span class="hi">by far the best of all.
