Indeed, the <span class="hi">Arminian universal Re­demption</span> we reject with a just abhorrence. The <span class="hi">Satisfaction</span> of our Lord Redeemer, was not <span class="hi">Intended</span> by Him, for the <span class="hi">Redemption</span> of <span class="hi">all</span> mankind; nor was it <span class="hi">Intended</span> any further than his <span class="hi">Intercession</span> is, which reaches only to the E­lect of God.

Certainly <span class="hi">Peter</span> was more be­holden unto the Merit of Christ for <span class="hi">his</span> Redemp­tion, than <span class="hi">Iudas</span> was for <span class="hi">his.</span> Yet the <span class="hi">Purchase</span> of Christ wonderfully binds us <span class="hi">all</span> to the <span class="hi">Service</span> of God.</p><p>For <span class="hi">First,</span> the <span class="hi">Redemption</span> of Christ has made our <span class="hi">Serving</span> of God, a <span class="hi">possible thing.</span> Had it not been for this, poor fallen undone man had never been in a Capacity to <span class="hi">serve</span> the Lord.

We must have continued the <span class="hi">Slaves</span> of the devil for ever, if the <span class="hi">Stings</span> of the Dragon had not fastned on the Lord.

They bring an Irresistible Deluge of Disorder upon all the Town and Land; and cause all the Countrey to swarm with the <span class="hi">workers of iniquity who call not upon the Lord.</span> And as the <span class="hi">prayer­less Householder</span> is now <span class="hi">cursed</span> by God, so he will one day be cursed by all his <span class="hi">House;</span> he <span class="hi">brings</span> curses on them, and they will <span class="hi">spend</span> curses on him, in the Day of Vengeance. In the ever­burning <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d31e6085"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=42919&amp;page=27">[Page]</a></span> lake, they will <span class="hi">curse</span> the day that ever they saw thy <span class="hi">prayerless house,</span> and, <span class="hi">That</span> House <span class="hi">brought me to this Hell!</span> This, this will be their Cry world without End.</p><p>Consider, next, the marvellous <span class="hi">Blessings</span> which belong to all <span class="hi">Praying Families.</span> It was noted a­bout the Family of <span class="hi">Obed-Edom,</span>in 1. Sam 6. 11. <span class="hi">The Lord blessed</span> Obed-Edom <span class="hi">and his househould,</span> while the <span class="hi">Ark of the Lord</span> was there. So shall it be noted about the Family of a <span class="hi">praying House­holder;</span> The Lord will <span class="hi">bless that man and his Household,</span> while that <span class="hi">Prayer to the Lord</span> is there. <span class="hi">Family-prayers,</span> are conjoined prayers, and <span class="hi">united</span> prayers; thus they become very <span class="hi">successful</span> pray­ers. What Encouragement is there given to them, in that promise, Matth. 18. 19. <span class="hi">If two of you shall agree on earth, touching any thing that they shall ask, it shall be done for them.</span> O let your Families <span class="hi">Agree</span> in the Asking of <span class="hi">grace,</span> in the Asking of <span class="hi">glory,</span> in the Asking of every <span class="hi">good thing; Prayer in Confort,</span> will obtain it all. When <span class="hi">Cornelius</span> was at his <span class="hi">Family-prayer,</span> what a signal favour did the Almighty God show unto him? Some while since, a whole Town in <span class="hi">Swit­zerland</span> was very suddenly destroyed by an <span class="hi">Earth-quake,</span> all except one peice of an house, in which a good man happned then to be at <span class="hi">Prayer</span> with his <span class="hi">Family.</span> Tis impossible to tell, <span class="hi">O how great is the goodness</span> which God has laid up for Houses that seek unto Him! But besides all the <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d31e6185"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=42919&amp;page=27">[Page]</a></span> other comforts of a <span class="hi">praying Householder,</span> he has <span class="hi">This</span> peculiar to him, <span class="hi">He teacheth all his Family to.</span> A praying <span class="hi">Parent</span> will have praying <span class="hi">chil­dren. David</span> prayed in his Family, and his Son <span class="hi">Solomon</span> prov'd a praying young man. A praying <span class="hi">Master</span> will have praying <span class="hi">Servants. A­braham</span> pray'd in his Family, and his Man <span class="hi">Elie­zer</span> became a very praying person. Thus, O man, all thy <span class="hi">young people,</span> will be filling every corner of thy house with <span class="hi">Prayers</span> for thy Felicity.</p><p>O consider of these things; and such let the Impression of them upon you be; That you may by <span class="hi">Prayers</span> with your <span class="hi">Families</span> Engage your <span class="hi">Houses</span> to <span class="hi">serve the Lord.</span></p></div><div class="section" id="index.xml-body.1_div.1_div.13"><h2><span class="headingNumber">1.13. </span><span class="head">SECT.

Twas said to <span class="hi">Timothy,</span> in Cap. 3. 15. <span class="hi">From a</span> Child <span class="hi">thou hast known the Holy Scriptures;</span> No doubt, his Godly Mother and Grandmother were the cause of his doing so. We should procure that our <span class="hi">Young</span> ones may <span class="hi">read</span> the <span class="hi">holy Scriptures,</span> and <span class="hi">mind</span> the <span class="hi">holy Scriptures,</span> and <span class="hi">know</span> the <span class="hi">holy Scriptures,</span> even <span class="hi">from a Child.</span> Let them have by heart, here and there a <span class="hi">Verse,</span> or a <span class="hi">Para­graph;</span> Especially in the <span class="hi">Psalms</span> and in the <span class="hi">Pro­verbs:</span> if you would have them <span class="hi">good,</span> teach them the <span class="hi">Psalmes</span> of <span class="hi">David;</span> if you would have them <span class="hi">wise,</span> teach them the <span class="hi">Proverbs</span> of <span class="hi">Solomon.</span> And Scripture<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span> <span class="hi">Stories</span> are to be told unto them, as soon as ever they enquire after <span class="hi">new</span> things and <span class="hi">strange.</span></p><p>But while we do thus, we are also to teach them the <span class="hi">Doctrines</span> of God. Inculcate upon them the <span class="hi">Principles of Religion,</span> as often as you do the Knife on the Stone in the <span class="hi">Whe<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>ting</span> of it. Twas said unto the Lord Jesus, in Matth. 22. 16. <span class="hi">Master, Thou <span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>e<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>chest the way of God in Truth.</span> Every <span class="hi">M<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>ster</span> should render his <span class="hi">young</span> ones able to say that unto himself, <span class="hi">Master, Thou <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d31e6554"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=42919&amp;page=29">[Page]</a></span> teachest the Truth of God.</span> Especially, We should be sure that they be not ignorant of any <span class="hi">Saving</span> Truths. Tell them, What they <span class="hi">are</span> come to by the <span class="hi">First Adam,</span> and what they <span class="hi">may</span> come to by the <span class="hi">Second Adam.</span> Tell them what <span class="hi">Covenant</span> man was once, and What Covenant man is <span class="hi">now</span> to be saved by. Yea, let none of the Things to be <span class="hi">believed,</span> none of the Things to be <span class="hi">practised,</span> none of the Things to be <span class="hi">pray'd for▪</span> be left unmentioned in your Instructions. All the <span class="hi">Lessons</span> of the <span class="hi">Creed,</span> the <span class="hi">Commandments,</span> and the <span class="hi">Lords Prayer</span> are to be laid before them. And we are to be particularly faithful to them, in the <span class="hi">present Truths;</span> the <span class="hi">labouring</span> Truths, the <span class="hi">witnessed</span> Truths of the Times, we should see ou<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span> young ones well informed in.

There are ferious <span class="hi">Questions</span> with which we are to <span class="hi">Instruct</span> our <span class="hi">Families.</span> And there are peculiarly Two Things which we are to <span class="hi">question</span> our young ones about.</p><p>Some <span class="hi">Questions</span> we are to put unto them, First, Which Concern their <span class="hi">Souls.</span></p><p>And here, yet further to particularize, We are to try them with <span class="hi">Questions</span> about their <span class="hi">Vnder­standing.</span> Our Lord Jesus asked his Disciples, in Matth. 13. 51. <span class="hi">Have ye</span> understood <span class="hi">all these things?</span> Thus are we to ask our young people, <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d31e6668"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=42919&amp;page=29">[Page]</a></span> <span class="hi">Do you</span> understand <span class="hi">the great Mystery of Godliness<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span></span> O keep up the great Ordinance of <span class="hi">Catechising</span> in your houses. Before your little Folks have left off living upon <span class="hi">Milk,</span> let them be so well vers­ed in their <span class="hi">Milk for Babes,</span> that they may readi­ly answer any Question there. The <span class="hi">Echoes</span> of this Exercise, are a most refreshing Melody in the ears of God himself. Ask we our young ones, What they think of <span class="hi">God,</span> and of <span class="hi">Christ,</span> and of <span class="hi">Themselves;</span> and let them be able to re­found the <span class="hi">Words of Truth.</span></p><p>We are to search them also with <span class="hi">Questions</span> a­bout their <span class="hi">Experience.</span> As our Lord asked His Family, in Joh. 16. 31. <span class="hi">Do ye now believe?</span> So should we ask our young people, <span class="hi">Have you</span> Experieneed <span class="hi">a work of</span> Regeneration <span class="hi">in your souls?</span> Ask them, <span class="hi">Have you ever yet carried a labouring and heavy-laden soul unto the Lord Iesus Christ?</span> It was the Advice of Wisdom, <span class="hi">Know the state of thy Flocks.</span> Thus, we should endeavour to <span class="hi">Know the state of the Souls</span> which we are to be concern­ed for; to <span class="hi">know</span> whether they are in a <span class="hi">Natural,</span> or a <span class="hi">Renewed</span> state.</p><p>Once more, We are to help them with <span class="hi">Quest­ions</span> about their <span class="hi">Temptations.</span> It was a <span class="hi">Question</span> once given to some, in Luc. 24. 38. <span class="hi">Why do Thoughts arise in your hearts?</span> Even so we should Enquire of our young people, <span class="hi">What</span> Thoughts <span class="hi">are you most troubled with?</span> Enquire, what <span class="hi">Fears,</span> enquire what <span class="hi">Snares</span> they are most endangered <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d31e6787"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=42919&amp;page=30">[Page 48]</a></span> by. Be alwaies jealous, lest <span class="hi">as the serpent beguil­ed Eve,</span> so their <span class="hi">minds be corrupted.</span> Moreover Some <span class="hi">Questions</span> we are to put upon them, Se­condly, which concern their <span class="hi">Lives.</span> It was once an Interrogatory which some were put un­to, in Luc. 23. 17. <span class="hi">What manner of communi­cations have ye?</span> Thus we are to Examine our young people about the <span class="hi">Words</span> and the <span class="hi">Works,</span> that fill their Lives. There are especially three things which they should be Examined about; their <span class="hi">Prayer,</span> their <span class="hi">Time,</span> and their <span class="hi">Company;</span> Ask them, whether they live without <span class="hi">Prayer</span> or no? Whether in Prayer they secretly and sin­cerely pour out their souls before the Lord? Ask them, How they spend their <span class="hi">Time?</span> How much <span class="hi">Idle Time,</span> and how much <span class="hi">useful</span> Time, they allow unto themselves? And ask them, What their <span class="hi">Company</span> is? Whom they sit withal? Whether <span class="hi">vain Persons</span> and <span class="hi">Fools,</span> or <span class="hi">the Saints which are the excellent,</span> and <span class="hi">all those that fear God?</span> Our Question will prove their <span class="hi">Safeguard,</span> if it be well administred.</p><p>Thirdly, There are faithful <span class="hi">Reproofs</span> with which we are to <span class="hi">Instruct</span> our <span class="hi">Families.</span> Tis said in Prov. 6. 33. <span class="hi">The</span> Reproofs <span class="hi">of Instruction are the way of life.</span> When we give <span class="hi">Instruction,</span> we shall have occasion to give <span class="hi">Reproof,</span> too often with it. There is no <span class="hi">Family</span> that has not Miscarri­ages that are to be <span class="hi">reproved</span> in it. <span class="hi">Young</span> peo­ple too commonly are <span class="hi">wild</span> people; and with­out <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d31e6906"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=42919&amp;page=30">[Page 49]</a></span> some <span class="hi">Castigations</span> they will rarely be kept in order. To some of them smart <span class="hi">Wor<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>s,</span> to others of them smart <span class="hi">Blowes,</span> will be too of­ten due. Tis said in Prov. 13. 24. <span class="hi">He that spareth his Rod hateth his s<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>n; but he that loveth him, chastens him betimes. Frowns</span> are due to all, and <span class="hi">Rods</span> to some Transgressors in the Family. But there are two Negative and two Positive Rules to be minded in <span class="hi">Reproving</span> of them.</p><p>The Negative Rules are these two.</p><p>First, <span class="hi">Reprove</span> not <span class="hi">Furiously.</span> It is said in <span class="hi">Iam. 1. 20. The wrath of man, worketh not the righ­teousness of God.</span> Remember, Nothing will be so well done <span class="hi">in</span> a passion, but what may be done better <span class="hi">out</span> of it. If you are to <span class="hi">chide,</span> yet chide not in a <span class="hi">Fury.</span> Do not call <span class="hi">vile Names;</span> much more, do not <span class="hi">swear,</span> do not <span class="hi">curse,</span> do not Rage with a <span class="hi">Tongue set on fire of hell.</span> If you are to <span class="hi">smi<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>e,</span> yet smite not in a <span class="hi">Fury.</span> Bloody, wound­ing, outragious Buffettings are to be avoided; lest there be cause to say of you, <span class="hi">Curs­ed is their Anger for it is fierce, and their Wrath for it is cruel.</span></p><p>Secondly <span class="hi">Reprove</span> not <span class="hi">for ever.</span> Tis said in <span class="hi">Ps. 103. 9. God will not</span> alwaies <span class="hi">chide, neither will He keep his anger for ever.</span> To be <span class="hi">alwaies</span> finding faults, is the way <span class="hi">never</span> to be curing them. A <span class="hi">perpetual Warngling</span> is a <span class="hi">continual Dropping,</span> which there is no enduring of; it prejudices the minds of them that feel it, against all that shall <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d31e7022"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=42919&amp;page=31">[Page 52]</a></span> be said unto them.</p><p>The <span class="hi">Positive</span> Rules are these Two.</p><p>First Reprove <span class="hi">Reasonably.</span> Let there be <span class="hi">just</span> Cause for it. When you <span class="hi">reprove,</span> it must be for a <span class="hi">true cause.</span> As it was said of our Saviour in <span class="hi">Isai. 11. 3. He shall not reprove after the hear­ing of His ears.</span> Thus, we may not go by meer <span class="hi">Hear-say,</span> when we reprove those that are under us. And it must be for a <span class="hi">great</span> Cause. Tis said of the Spirit in <span class="hi">Io<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>. 16. 8. He will reprove the world for SIN.</span> The sinful thing, the thing for <span class="hi">which the wrath of God comes,</span> the thing which the <span class="hi">soul of the Lord hates,</span> this we are to reprove. We must not throw away <span class="hi">Reproofs</span> upon <span class="hi">Nothing,</span> or upon <span class="hi">Every thing.</span></p><p>Secondly, Reprove <span class="hi">Scripturally.</span> Tis said in 2. Tim. 3. 16. <span class="hi">All Scripture is profitable for Re­proof.</span> A <span class="hi">Reproof</span> with a <span class="hi">Scripture</span> comes with a more than ordinary Majesty and Authority. When we Reprove those that are under us, First, make them read a <span class="hi">Text</span> which does Con­demn what we would rebuke, and then set it home with a very warm lively vigorous Appli­cation.</p><p>Fourthly, There are solemn <span class="hi">Charges</span> with which we are to <span class="hi">Instruct</span> our <span class="hi">Families.</span> It was the Character which the Lord gives of <span class="hi">Abraham,</span> in Gen. 18. 19. <span class="hi">I know him, that he will</span> command <span class="hi">his children and his</span> household <span class="hi">after him, and they shall keep the way of the Lord.</span> O that this might <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d31e7126"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=42919&amp;page=31">[Page]</a></span> be said of every <span class="hi">Householder</span> here; <span class="hi">I know him, that he will take all of his house, one by one, and</span> Charge <span class="hi">every one of them to keep the way of the Lord!</span> What saies the Apostle, in i<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span> Thes 2. 11. <span class="hi">We</span> charged <span class="hi">every one of you, as a father his children.</span> We should call aside our <span class="hi">young</span> people, and lay upon them, the Charge of <span class="hi">Da­vid,</span> in 1. Chron. 28. 9. <span class="hi">My son, know thou the God of thy Father, and</span> Serve Him <span class="hi">with a per­fect Heart and a willing mind; for the Lord search­eth all Hearts▪ if thou seek Him, He will be found of thee, if thou forsake Him, He will cast thee off for ever.</span></p><p>Charge them; and this especially about four Things. Lay upon them that <span class="hi">Charge</span> of God in 1. Joh. 3. 23. <span class="hi">This is His Commandment, that you believe on the Name of his Son.</span> Charge them to accept of Christ Jesus, as their <span class="hi">Prince</span> and their <span class="hi">Saviour;</span> Charge them to repair unto Christ Jesus for <span class="hi">Wisdom, Righteousness, Sanctifica­tion, and Redemption.</span> Lay also upon them that Charge of God, in Mat. 6. 6. <span class="hi">Enter into thy Clo­set and pray to thy Father in secret.</span> Charge them to Retire for their <span class="hi">Devotions</span> every day; Charge them to let not a day pass them, without Crying to <span class="hi">God</span> for His Mercy, and Pardon, and Salva­tion. Once more, Lay upon them that <span class="hi">Charge</span> of God, in Prov. 1. 10. <span class="hi">My son, if Sinners en­tice thee, consent thou not,</span> Charge them, that they be not the <span class="hi">Companions of Fools;</span> Charge <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d31e7215"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=42919&amp;page=32">[Page 52]</a></span> them that they do not associate themselves into an Intimacy and a Familiarity with any but such as may be sober, discreet, blameless persons. Finally, Lay upon them that <span class="hi">Charge</span> of God in Hag. 1. 5. <span class="hi">Thus saith the Lord of hosts,</span> Consi­der your waies. Charge them, that they <span class="hi">Con­sider</span> what their present Condition is, and what their future Condition is <span class="hi">like</span> to be; Charge them, that they <span class="hi">consider</span> of their past Behaviours, and of the <span class="hi">Death,</span> and <span class="hi">Iudgment,</span> and <span class="hi">Eternity</span> which is yet before them. A young man has be­come a real Convert by being obliged unto <span class="hi">Con­sideration</span> for one Quarter of an Hour in a Day. Wish for them, say to them, <span class="hi">Oh that they were wise, that they would</span> Consider! In a word, Let your Charge on them, be that, which Holy <span class="hi">Bolton</span> gave to his Children, when he dyed, <span class="hi">I charge you, that at the Day of Iudgement, none of you dare to meet me in an</span> Unregenerate <span class="hi">estate.</span></p><p>Secondly. The <span class="hi">Manner</span> of <span class="hi">Family-Instruction.</span></p><p>Tis to be performed in such a <span class="hi">Manner,</span> as may best Attain the Ends of it. Particularly.</p><p>First, We are to <span class="hi">Instruct</span> our Families very <span class="hi">Seasonably.</span> We are told in Matth, 24. 45. The <span class="hi">Ruler over the Household</span> is to <span class="hi">give them their meat in due</span> Season. There lies much in the <span class="hi">Time</span> we take for the <span class="hi">Work.</span> We should indeed have our <span class="hi">Frequent</span> Times, to do it: We should speak what may be for the <span class="hi">Instruction</span> of our Families, <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d31e7307"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=42919&amp;page=32">[Page 53]</a></span> every day, and often in a day; and on various occasions be dropping our savoury Admonitions. Even when we sit at the <span class="hi">Table,</span> we should rare­ly Rise without feeding the <span class="hi">Minds,</span> as well as the <span class="hi">Mouthes</span> of our Attendents. Much more at the <span class="hi">H<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>urs of Prayer,</span> we should do something that may make them more acquainted with <span class="hi">Divine Objects</span> then they were before. But we should likewise have our <span class="hi">Stated</span> Times to do it. Especially <span class="hi">Sacred</span> Time will be very proper­ly a <span class="hi">Stated</span> Time for it.

Men <span class="hi">seek out many inventions</span> to excuse themselves from bearing an humble but a <span class="hi">faithful Testimony</span> against any sinful thing which their Superiors may in­vite them to. One of these <span class="hi">Inventions</span> is men­tioned in the fourth verse of this Chapter; it is drawn from the <span class="hi">Vncontrouleable Power</span> of them that sometimes enjoin a sinful thing. To this Excuse we have a two-fold Answer in the fifth verse. We have two things in it. First, the Good of <span class="hi">Religion.</span> Tis sai<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>, <span class="hi">Whoso keepeth the commandment shall feel no evil thing.</span> q. d. Be true to Gods Commandments &amp; thy own Con­science, let who will be offended at it; the wonderful providence of the Almighty will in the mean time be concerned for thy Safety and Security. A man gets no real Hurt by doing of his Duty. Secondly, the Need of <span class="hi">Discretion.</span> Tis said <span class="hi">A wise mans heart discerneth both</span> Time <span class="hi">and Iudgment.</span> q. d. In the doing of this, and every other Duty, two things are to be much regarded. Mind the <span class="hi">Season</span> of the duty, and mind the <span class="hi">Manner</span> of the duty: much harm will thereby be prevented in discharging of it. Tis the former of these two Regardables that I would now insist upon. Behold a <span class="hi">general</span> Rule apply'd unto a <span class="hi">particular</span> Case: the Case is, <span class="hi">the Rebuking and Refusing of Sin;</span> but the Rule is, <span class="hi">A wise <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d31e8736"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=42919&amp;page=39">[Page]</a></span> man alwai<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>s will</span> discern <span class="hi">his time to do what he has to do.</span> To <span class="hi">Discern</span> the Time,—it must needs also signifie to <span class="hi">Improve</span> the Time.

There are two things incumbent on us; to <span class="hi">Do</span> good, and to <span class="hi">Get</span> good. The good we are to <span class="hi">do,</span> is to <span class="hi">Honour</span> God; and the good we are to <span class="hi">get,</span> is to <span class="hi">Enjoy</span> God. Those two things comprise all our <span class="hi">Duties;</span> and they make up the <span class="hi">Errand</span> which we come into the World upon. Now, while we are in this world, God allowes us a <span class="hi">Time</span> for this work; we have <span class="hi">time</span> not only in the larger sense of it, but also in the stricter sense of it; We have <span class="hi">time</span> not only in <span class="hi">Duration,</span> but also in <span class="hi">Opportunity.</span> There is not any <span class="hi">Duty</span> enjoined up­pon us, but there is a <span class="hi">Season</span> for it allowed un­to us. Tis an Observation about the things that <span class="hi">shall</span> be, in Eccles. 3. 1. <span class="hi">To every thing there is a</span> Season, <span class="hi">and a</span> Time <span class="hi">to every purpose.</span> Thus it may be said about the things that <span class="hi">should</span> be, <span class="hi">There is no</span> Duty, <span class="hi">but God hath provided us a</span> Time <span class="hi">and a</span> Season <span class="hi">for it.</span> We have some <span class="hi">golden spots of Time,</span> whereof we may say, <span class="hi">This is the</span> <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d31e8873"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=42919&amp;page=40">[Page 68]</a></span> Time <span class="hi">for such a duty;</span> and again, <span class="hi">This is the</span> Time <span class="hi">for another duty.</span></p><p>First, We have a <span class="hi">Time</span> to <span class="hi">do Good</span> while we are here in the world.

The <span class="hi">Good</span> which we are to <span class="hi">do</span> is expressed in <span class="hi">Mic. 6. 8.

When the Gales of <span class="hi">Opportunity</span> blow in the Sails of <span class="hi">Time,</span> every man should see and watch his own <span class="hi">Opportunity.</span> To <span class="hi">Discern</span> the Time, is to <span class="hi">mind</span> the time, and to <span class="hi">use</span> the time, for the performance of our <span class="hi">Duty.</span> Now tis a <span class="hi">wise</span> man that will so <span class="hi">discern</span> the <span class="hi">Time. Sapience</span> or <span class="hi">Wisdom</span> is a Vertue of the <span class="hi">Vnderstanding,</span> whereby a man perceives the <span class="hi">Dependence</span> of things; the <span class="hi">Co<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>nexion</span> of things, and the <span class="hi">Con­sequence of things</span> being understood, therein <span class="hi">Wis­dom</span> is discovered. To <span class="hi">discern the time</span> is an in­stance of this. Tis <span class="hi">Wisdom</span> for a man to lay his <span class="hi">Time</span> and his <span class="hi">Work</span> together. Tis <span class="hi">Wisdom</span> for a man to fore-see what will be the Issue of such a <span class="hi">Work</span> at such a <span class="hi">Time.</span> But besides the <span class="hi">Nature</span> of <span class="hi">Wisdom</span> evidently appearing in this thing, we have a two fold further witness to the <span class="hi">Wisdom</span> of it.</p><p>First, The <span class="hi">Testimony</span> of <span class="hi">Scripture</span> there about, shewes, that it is <span class="hi">Wisdome</span> for men to <span class="hi">discern</span> and <span class="hi">improve</span> their <span class="hi">time.</span> What the all-<span class="hi">wise,</span> the only-<span class="hi">wise</span> GOD calleth <span class="hi">Wisdom,</span> is unquestionably to be esteemed so. The <span class="hi">Redeeming</span> of <span class="hi">Time</span> is great Wisdom in the Language and the Account of God. Twas said in Eph. 5. 16. <span class="hi">Walk as</span> wise, Redeeming <span class="hi">the time—</span>Much of the same <span class="hi">Date</span> <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d31e9193"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=42919&amp;page=41">[Page 70]</a></span> and <span class="hi">Tenour,</span> was the Epistle to the <span class="hi">Colossians.</span> In that Epistle also we have the like passage, in Cap. 4. 5. <span class="hi">Walk in</span> Wisdom, Redeeming <span class="hi">the time.</span> Tis probable the Apostle therein has a special Reference to Persecutions, which good men were then exposed unto. To <span class="hi">Redeem the Time,</span> was a proverbial Phrase of old, signify­ing, To <span class="hi">Keep out of trouble as long as one can.</span> Thus the <span class="hi">Chaldean</span>-Soothsayers were told in their distress, <span class="hi">Dan. 2. 8. I know that ye would</span> gain <span class="hi">the time.</span> This was the Counsil of the Apostle, <span class="hi">By a prudent, holy, careful, and inoffensive Carri­age towards them that would interrupt you in the worship of Iesus Christ,</span> gain Time <span class="hi">what you can for the quiet practice of it.</span> Well, If it be <span class="hi">Wis­dom</span> to <span class="hi">gain</span> time <span class="hi">for</span> the Service of God, surely, tis Wisdom to <span class="hi">spend</span> time <span class="hi">in</span> the Service of God. It was the singular Character &amp; Commendation of the <span class="hi">Issacharites,</span> in 1. Chron. 12. 32. <span class="hi">They had</span> Understanding <span class="hi">in the</span> times, <span class="hi">to</span> know <span class="hi">what Is­rael ought to do.</span> Tis an <span class="hi">understanding</span> man, who doth so <span class="hi">know</span> his <span class="hi">Time,</span> as to <span class="hi">do</span> his <span class="hi">Work.</span> Of a <span class="hi">Time-losing</span> man, the Scripture saith, <span class="hi">He is a Fool.</span> It saies in Prov. 18. 16. <span class="hi">Wherefore is there a price in the hand of a</span> Fool?</p><p>Secondly, The <span class="hi">Prevention</span> of <span class="hi">Sorrow</span> thereby, shewes, That it is <span class="hi">Wisdom</span> for men to <span class="hi">discern</span> and <span class="hi">improve</span> their <span class="hi">Time.</span> It is great <span class="hi">Wisdom</span> to prevent great <span class="hi">Sorrow.</span> Now nothing in the world fills the heart of man more with Anguish <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d31e9322"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=42919&amp;page=41">[Page 71]</a></span> and Anger, than the <span class="hi">Missing</span> of Time. When a man has missed his <span class="hi">Time</span> for his <span class="hi">Work,</span> it caus­eth an unspeakable Regret within him. We read of some professors, who missed their <span class="hi"><span class="gap" title="〈◊〉"> [...]</span></span> to Entertain Christ Jesus and His Mercy: with what a marvellous Agony did they cry out, in Matth. 25. 11. <span class="hi">Lord, Lord, open to us!</span> Well might they be called <span class="hi">Foolish,</span> who thus cam<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span> too late. The horrour of it being once only Re­presented by some profane people, who acted the <span class="hi">Foolish Virgins</span> in a Play, at a City in <span class="hi">Germany,</span> it even kill'd a Prince that was a Spectator of it. Tis impossible to utter the Confusion which the slipping of <span class="hi">time</span> does put the souls of men into. When <span class="hi">Esau</span> had missed his <span class="hi">Time</span> to procure a Blessing for himself, how did he resent it? We are told in Gen. 27. 34. <span class="hi">He cry'd with a</span> great <span class="hi">and</span> exceeding bitter <span class="hi">Cry.</span> Alas, how should it be otherwise? The slipping of <span class="hi">Time</span> is an <span class="hi">Ill, and an</span> exceeding bitter <span class="hi">thing.</span> There are but two sorts of men; both of them find the <span class="hi">Loss of time,</span> to prove at some time or other, a sad, an evil, a troublesome thing unto them, 'Tis thus esqecially when their time is come to <span class="hi">Dy,</span> when their time is to <span class="hi">be no more.</span> As for <span class="hi">Good men,</span> the <span class="hi">Loss of time</span> usually strowes <span class="hi">Thorns</span> on their <span class="hi">Beds</span> when they come to dy. It grieves the best man to think, My Time, <span class="hi">my</span> Time, <span class="hi">I have not so laid it out for God as I should have done.</span> He was a painful &amp; a pious Minister of the Gos­pel, <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d31e9421"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=42919&amp;page=42">[Page 72]</a></span> who yet breathed out this among his last, Groans, <span class="hi">O the Loss</span> of Time! <span class="hi">it <span class="gap" title="〈…〉"> [...]</span> on my spirit now.</span> As for <span class="hi">Bad men,</span> the <span class="hi">Loss of Time</span> flash<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span> Hell fire into their spirits when they come to Dy.

First,</p><p>There are the Trials of Divine <span class="hi">Examinations,</span> Which will be critical upon us. Tis said in Psal. 11. 4, 5. <span class="hi">The Lords eyes behold, and His ey-lids</span> try <span class="hi">the children of men; the Lord</span> sounds (as the French Translation hath it) <span class="hi">both the righ­teous and the wicked.</span> Every man in the world falls under the <span class="hi">Notice,</span> and so, under the <span class="hi">Tryal</span> of the omniscient God. The all-seeing <span class="hi">Eyes</span> of God, as it were, <span class="hi">Examine</span> us, and His <span class="hi">Ey-lids</span> knit themselves for a Scrutiny into our Hearts and lives. The blessed God will pass a <span class="hi">Iudgment,</span> after a <span class="hi">Trial</span> upon us; whether we <span class="hi">truly love Him and seek Him,</span> or no. We are told in Psal. 7. 9. <span class="hi">The righteous God</span> trieth <span class="hi">the Hearts and the Reins;</span> an Assertion, an Expression, it may be, more than seven times repeted in the Word of God! The <span class="hi">Examination</span> and <span class="hi">Observa­tion</span> of God, extends it self to the most interior parts of men; the motions of their very <span class="hi">Hearts</span> and <span class="hi">Reins</span> come under His exactest Cognizance. Every man may so far say after that godly man, in Psal. 17. 3. Lord, <span class="hi">thou hast proved my heart, thou hast visited me, thiu hast</span> tried <span class="hi">me.</span> To use a <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d31e11302"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=42919&amp;page=50">[Page 88]</a></span> Similitude made Legitimate and Canonical by the Apostle himself, in Heb. 4. 13. The <span class="hi">Sa­crificeing Knife</span> of old, never did penetrate so far into the Bowels of the Creatures it was imploy­ed upon; it never laid them so <span class="hi"><span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>aked</span> and <span class="hi">open,</span> before the standers-by; as the <span class="hi">examining Eye</span> of God makes a discovery of what is in our Souls and our wayes.</p><p>Secondly, There are the Trials of Divine <span class="hi">Dis­pensations</span> which we must have Experience of▪ God's <span class="hi">Providences</span> are our <span class="hi">Probations;</span> by them we are <span class="hi">tried</span> what we are. The things which be­fal us in the world, fetch out of us, those things which manifest what <span class="hi">metal</span> we are made of. Particularly, tis said in 2. Cor. 6. 3, 7. We are <span class="hi">Approved by</span> things on the <span class="hi">Right hand</span> and on the <span class="hi">Left.</span></p><p>First, The <span class="hi">Merciful</span> Dispensations of God, are <span class="hi">Trials</span> of us: these are Trials on the <span class="hi">Right</span> hand. It is a sacred Proverb, in <span class="hi">Prov. 27. 21. As the Fining-pot for silver, and the Furnace for</span> Gold, <span class="hi">so is a man to his praise;</span> or <span class="hi">so the mouth which praises any one, is to try him.</span> As when a man is <span class="hi">praised</span> by his Neighbour, so when a man is <span class="hi">Blessed</span> of his Maker, he is then <span class="hi">tried</span> unto the utmost. <span class="hi">Ho­nours</span> from below, do <span class="hi">Indicare virum;</span> they soon <span class="hi">Try</span> &amp; <span class="hi">show</span> the man that is perfum'd therewith; and the same is done by <span class="hi">Merc<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>es</span> from above.

Now I will</span> try <span class="hi">them there.</span> The Favours of God, as it were, put us into a <span class="hi">Crucible,</span> in a <span class="hi">Furnace,</span> where it soon becomes ap­parent, whether we fear him or no. They are so many Trials, <span class="hi">Whether we will hear God speaking to us in our prosperity;</span> or <span class="hi">whether when we wax fat, we shall kick against the Lord.</span></p><p>Secondly, The <span class="hi">Afflictive</span> Dispensations of God, are likewise <span class="hi">Tryals</span> of us. And these are Trials on the <span class="hi">Left hand.</span> So much is intimated in 1. Pet. 1. 6, 7. <span class="hi">Ye are in heaviness thro' many</span> Temp­tations, <span class="hi">that the</span> trial <span class="hi">of your faith, being much more precious than that of gold which perisheth, though it be tried with fire, may be found unto praise.</span> All <span class="hi">Afflictions</span> are <span class="hi">Tentations;</span> by them we are <span class="hi">tried</span> whether we have the Grace of God in us or no. Tis <span class="hi">Faith,</span> but not Faith <span class="hi">alone,</span> which our <span class="hi">Trou­bles</span> here are the <span class="hi">Trials</span> of. A <span class="hi">Sick-bed</span> is a <span class="hi">Fur­nace,</span> a <span class="hi">Reproach</span> is a <span class="hi">Furnace,</span> a <span class="hi">Loss,</span> or a <span class="hi">Goal</span> is a <span class="hi">Furnace,</span> in which tis <span class="hi">tried</span> whether we have the spirits, not of <span class="hi">Bastards,</span> but of <span class="hi">Children</span> in us. Hence we read of <span class="hi">A great</span> Tryal <span class="hi">of</span> Affliction. <span class="hi">Afflicted</span> persons may make that Confession in Ps. 66. 10, 11, <span class="hi">Thou, O God, hast</span> proved <span class="hi">us, thou hast</span> tried <span class="hi">us as silver is</span> tried; <span class="hi">thou hast laid</span> Af­fliction <span class="hi">upon our loins.</span> Hereby we are Try'd <span class="hi">whether we will despise the Chastning of the Lord,</span> or <span class="hi">whether we will faint when rebuked of Him.</span></p></div><div class="proposition" id="index.xml-body.1_div.3_div.2"><h2><span class="headingNumber">3.2. </span><span class="head">Proposition II.</span></h2><p><span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d31e11562"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=42919&amp;page=51">[Page 90]</a></span> Upon the <span class="hi">Trials</span> of God, good men <span class="hi">come forth as gold.</span></p><p>There is that in <span class="hi">Gold,</span> which good men may be compar'd unto. We read in Deut. 1. 1. about the mountains of <span class="hi">Dizahab:</span> that is, the <span class="hi">Golden</span> mountains; because <span class="hi">Gold</span> was probably dug from thence. The <span class="hi">Churches</span> of God in the world, are such <span class="hi">Mountains</span> of gold. Every true Believer is a rich lump of <span class="hi">Gold</span> before the Lord. Of such persons tis said in Lam. 4. 2. <span class="hi">They are the precious sons of Zion, comparable to fine</span> gold. There are diverse properties in <span class="hi">Gold,</span> which a good man will have a blessed Resemblance of. I should offer you not <span class="hi">Gold,</span> but <span class="hi">Hay</span> and <span class="hi">stubble</span> if I should read you here a <span class="hi">Lecture</span> of <span class="hi">Metallogy,</span> or discourse to you all that I could Philosophize about this King of <span class="hi">Metals.</span> Let me only touch on a few common Reflections, As now,</p><p><span class="hi">Gold</span> is a <span class="hi">pure</span> metal. Hence we read near some scores of times in the sacred Scripture, a­bout <span class="hi">pure Gold.</span> It will not readily admit a Mix­ture▪ or an Alloy with more imperfect Metals; unless with <span class="hi">Silver:</span> Especially the <span class="hi">Dust-gold</span> of <span class="hi">Guinea,</span> Gold whereof <span class="hi">Iob</span> saith, tis <span class="hi">Dust of gold:</span> wonderful is the <span class="hi">Purity</span> thereof! Thus a good man is a <span class="hi">pure</span> man; He is one of those that are called in <span class="hi">Matth. 5. 8. The pure in heart:</span> He is <span class="hi">pure</span> in his <span class="hi">Ends, pure</span> in his principles, <span class="hi">pure</span> in his practises, <span class="hi">pure</span> from the dross of <span class="hi">Lust:</span> and he is not so much <span class="hi">Nominally</span> as really, <span class="hi">A Puritan.</span></p><p><span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d31e11687"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=42919&amp;page=51">[Page 91]</a></span> Again▪ Gold is a <span class="hi">Ductil</span> Metal. Tis marvel­lously extensible when beaten into Leaves; twere incredible to tell how far one Grain of <span class="hi">Gold</span> may be extended and continued. So dense and com­pacted, and united, are the parts of it, that an Ounce of it may be beaten (I suppose) into a Thousand Leaves. Thus a good Man can be <span class="hi">Drawn forth</span> into large Expressions of goodness and vertue. It was said by such an one in Psal. 11. 3. <span class="hi">My goodness Extendeth.</span> He <span class="hi">extends</span> his Piety, his Charity, he <span class="hi">extends</span> his lnfluence far and near; and he is a <span class="hi">Diffusive</span> good.</p><p>Once more, <span class="hi">Gold</span> is a <span class="hi">Beautiful</span> metal. 'Tis called, <span class="hi">Aurum,</span> for that very cause; <span class="hi">ab Aura,</span> i. e. <span class="hi">a Splendore.</span> Tis a shining and glitt'ring thing; and hence things that are very splendid, are said to be <span class="hi">covered with <span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>ellow</span> Gold.

There is a Lustre on the <span class="hi">Face,</span> and a Lustre in the <span class="hi">Walk</span> of such a man; he has even the Splen­dor of <span class="hi">A light in the world.</span></p><p>Furthermore, <span class="hi">Gold</span> is a <span class="hi">Durable</span> Metal. Tho' the Bible affirms that it is <span class="hi">Corruptible,</span> and <span class="hi"><span class="gap" title="•••"> [...]</span> ­kerable,</span> and <span class="hi">Perishing,</span> yet there is a mighty <span class="hi">Strength</span> to be ascribed unto it.

His Character is that in Matth. 24. 13. <span class="hi">He shall</span> endure <span class="hi">to the end.</span> No <span class="hi">Fire,</span> no <span class="hi">Water,</span> no Vexation shall con­sume his Devotion.

Even <span class="hi">Lead</span> it self in its weight, is to <span class="hi">Gold</span> as far short as <span class="hi">Sixty</span> is of an <span class="hi">Hundred;</span> if I mistake it not. Such is the <span class="hi">Quality,</span> such the <span class="hi">Gravity</span> of a good man. A godly man is a <span class="hi">Weighty</span> man. Tis said in Prov. 12. 26. <span class="hi">A righteous man is more excel­lent than his neighbour.</span> One such man will weigh down multitudes and myriads of other men. His being a <span class="hi">pondering man,</span> it soon makes him become <span class="hi">ponderous</span> man. His unconverted Neighbourhood may own of him, <span class="hi">Thou art worth ten thousand of us.</span></p><p>Finally <span class="hi">Gold</span> is a <span class="hi">precious</span> Metal.

Its precious also for the <span class="hi">Price</span> which tis of in <span class="hi">Esteem;</span> the <span class="hi">Auri sacra fames,</span> the unhallowed Appetite which men crave it with, prefers it above all common things. Tis in Scripture-phrase a <span class="hi">pre­cious</span> thing indeed, of which it might be said, <span class="hi">It is more precious than gold.</span> But of a good man might such a thing be spoken: it may be said of such a man, as in <span class="hi">Isa. 13. 12.</span> The man is <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d31e11929"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=42919&amp;page=52">[Page 93]</a></span> <span class="hi">more precious than fine</span> gold; <span class="hi">even than the golden wedge of</span> Ophir; [i. e. <span class="hi">Peru,</span> as some with much pretense of Reason do conjecture it] A <span class="hi">graci­ous</span> man, is a <span class="hi">precious</span> man; all Beholders ought to put a value upon him; he is even, <span class="hi">precious in the eyes of the Lord.</span></p><p>Thus like to <span class="hi">Gold</span> will good men come forth, under and after the <span class="hi">Tryals</span> of the Lord; which comprehends these two Conclusions in it.</p><div class="conclusion" id="index.xml-body.1_div.3_div.2_div.1"><h3><span class="headingNumber">3.2.1. </span><span class="head">Conclusion.

Indeed, <span class="hi">Blessed are the dead who dy in the Lord,</span> for they too are alwaies <span class="hi">praising</span> of Him. But yet they rest from some <span class="hi">Praises,</span> when they <span class="hi">rest from their Labours</span> here. The departed Saints are continually shouting, <span class="hi">H<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>llelujah, Hallelujah,</span> before the Throne of God. The Saints, they are <span class="hi">joyful in glory;</span> and the <span class="hi">High Praises</span> of God are perpetually Proceeding from those blessed Souls. But Christians in this world have their <span class="hi">peculiar Opportunities,</span> to be Glorifying of Him that made them. This did the <span class="hi">Psalmist</span> speak in Ps 88. 11. <span class="hi">Shall the</span> dead <span class="hi">praise thee?</span> To in­stance in some particulars:</p><p>The <span class="hi">Living</span> here may be <span class="hi">praising</span> of God by the Discharge of many <span class="hi">Relations,</span> which the <span class="hi">dead</span> Saints are strangers unto. We may <span class="hi">now</span> praise God as <span class="hi">Parents,</span> as <span class="hi">Masters,</span> as <span class="hi">Officers</span> in the the Church or Common-Wealth.

There is a Three-fold <span class="hi">Desire of Life</span> which the Living have. There is a <span class="hi">Natural</span> Desire of Life. This is common both to <span class="hi">good</span> men and <span class="hi">bad</span> men. <span class="hi">Na­ture</span> it self startles at the Approach of <span class="hi">Death;</span> In­nocent Nature shivers and recoyls, when this <span class="hi">King of Terrors</span> is ready to lay his cold l<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>y hand upon us. This was <span class="hi">Ioab</span>'s Desire: that valiant Souldier, The <span class="hi">Lord-General</span> of <span class="hi">Israel</span> himself, in 1. King. 2. 28. being in cold blood under Ap­prehensions of <span class="hi">Death,</span> fled unto the Horns of the <span class="hi">Altar,</span> as a Sanctuary to save his <span class="hi">Life.</span> There is also a <span class="hi">Sensual</span> Desire of Life. This is that which <span class="hi">Bad</span> men are under the power of. Many are loth to dye because they would not leave the <span class="hi">Pleasures</span> and <span class="hi">Profits</span> and <span class="hi">Honours</span> which did sur­round them here. They are like the Miser who on his Death-Bed, hugg'd his Baggs of Gold, and cry'd out, <span class="hi">Must I leave you? Must I leave you?</span> Their Love of their <span class="hi">Life,</span> comes from their love of their <span class="hi">Flesh.</span> This was the <span class="hi">Rich Fools</span> Desire, in Luc 12. 20. He wished for <span class="hi">many Years,</span> that he might <span class="hi">eat and drink,</span> and <span class="hi">be merry</span> here.</p><p>There is likewise a <span class="hi">gracious</span> Desire of Life. And <span class="hi">this</span> is that which <span class="hi">good</span> men are affected with: They desire to <span class="hi">live,</span> because they desire to <span class="hi">praise.</span> They would live, because they would honour <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d31e14181"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=42919&amp;page=63">[Page 114]</a></span> God in those matters &amp; those manners for which their Lives do afford them blessed <span class="hi">Opportunities</span> and <span class="hi">Advantages.</span> Now this <span class="hi">gracious</span> Desire of of Life is a <span class="hi">Regular</span> Desire. A <span class="hi">Desire</span> of Life for the <span class="hi">Praise</span> of God, is the only <span class="hi">Desire</span> of Life, that will have praise of God. This was <span class="hi">David</span>'s Desire when he was visited with Sick­ness, when he was <span class="hi">weak,</span> and his Bones were <span class="hi">pained,</span> then said he in Psal. 6. 5. <span class="hi">O save me, for in</span> Death <span class="hi">there is</span> no Remembrance <span class="hi">of thee, in the</span> Grave <span class="hi">who shall give thee thanks?</span> Such Desires are the only <span class="hi">right</span> and <span class="hi">chast</span> Desires. It is not fit for a Christian to say, I desire <span class="hi">to</span> live, <span class="hi">because I am</span> afraid <span class="hi">to dy.</span> Much less is it fit for him to say, <span class="hi">I</span> desire <span class="hi">my</span> life in <span class="hi">the world, that I may turn and wind still the Affairs</span> of <span class="hi">the World.</span> But This is that which Leg<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>timates the Desire of Life: As every thing is to be <span class="hi">i<span class="gap" title="••"> [...]</span>roved</span> for God, so every thing should be <span class="hi">desired</span> for God. And thus <span class="hi">Life</span> it self. We are daily <span class="hi">Praying,</span> as he in Psal. 102. 24. <span class="hi">O my God, take me not away in the midst of my dayes.</span> Well, Our God enquires of us, <span class="hi">Why art thou unwilling to be taken away in the midst of thy dayes?</span> We should have this to be our true Account of it, <span class="hi">Because, O Lord, I am loth to be taken away in the midst of my</span> Praise.</p></div><div class="proposition" id="index.xml-body.1_div.4_div.3"><h2><span class="headingNumber">4.3. </span><span class="head">PROP.

And he that shall consult other passages in this Hundred-and-nineteenth Psalm, will find both under this Notion insisted on. The <span class="hi">Scriptures</span> of Truth, and the <span class="hi">Troubles of</span> Life.</p><p>First, The <span class="hi">Word</span> of God is to be <span class="hi">sought</span> as the <span class="hi">Help,</span> of our <span class="hi">Praising</span> Him. The Prophet of old could say as in <span class="hi">Mich. 6. 8. The Lord hath shew­ed thee, O man, the thing that good is.</span> Thus, the Lord hath <span class="hi">shewed</span> us how to be <span class="hi">praising</span> of Him, by <span class="hi">living</span> to Him. But Where has he shewed it? Truly in the sacred <span class="hi">Bible.</span> The Bible is the <span class="hi">Di­rectory</span> given to us. Every Child is well taught to say, <span class="hi">The Scriptures of the Old and New Testa­ment are the Rule which God hath given to instruct us how we are to glorify Him.</span> To order a <span class="hi">Life</span> in a dark world, is as hard as to manage a <span class="hi">Ship</span> in a dark night, we are in the <span class="hi">Dark</span> about the <span class="hi">Practises</span> which our lives are to be employed in. What shall we then do that we may leave no part of our due Homage to God unperformed? The Apostle speaks fully to this Case in 2. Pet. 1. 18. <span class="hi">We have a sure word of Prophecy, whereto ye do well to take heed, as to a</span> light <span class="hi">shining in a</span> dark <span class="hi">place.</span> There, There it is: our Bible is our <span class="hi">Pole-Star:</span> keep an eye to That and we shall <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d31e14402"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=42919&amp;page=64">[Page 116]</a></span> shape a course Right. All the <span class="hi">Directions,</span> all the <span class="hi">Promises,</span> all the <span class="hi">Threatnings</span> of God, will be so many Helps, of our Obedience. If any man ask, <span class="hi">How do the</span> Scriptures <span class="hi">of God help men in the</span> Prais­es <span class="hi">of God?</span> Know, The Scriptures themselves give an Answer thereunto, in Psal. 19. 7, 8. <span class="hi">The law of the Lord converts the soul, the testimonies of the Lord make wise the simple; the statutes of the Lord rejoice the heart; the commandments of the Lord enlighten the eyes.</span> That <span class="hi">Conversion,</span> that <span class="hi">Instruction,</span> that <span class="hi">Ioy</span> and that <span class="hi">Ligh<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span></span> which the <span class="hi">Word</span> of God affords unto us, will be no little Help in the <span class="hi">Praise</span> of God.</p><p>Secondly, The <span class="hi">Rod</span> of God is to be <span class="hi">used</span> as the Help of our Praising Him. The Lord sends ma­ny <span class="hi">Afflictions</span> upon us. An <span class="hi">H<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>man,</span> is afflicted in his mind: a <span class="hi">Iob</span> is Afflicted in his Estate; a <span class="hi">Gaius</span> is afflicted in his Body, a <span class="hi">Paul</span> in his Credit, and a <span class="hi">David</span> in his Children, they <span class="hi">live ill</span> and they <span class="hi">dy worse</span> before him. What is the Use we are now to make of these things? Truly our <span class="hi">Afflictions</span> are to be the Help of our <span class="hi">Devotions.</span> It is the Call of God in <span class="hi">Mic 6. 9. Hear the Rod.</span> As we should hear the <span class="hi">Voice</span> of the Rod, so we should use the <span class="hi">Help</span> of the Rod. By our <span class="hi">Afflictions</span> we should be <span class="hi">helped</span> unto more Se­riousness, more Watchfulness, more Fruitful­ness. Now those things are to the <span class="hi">Praise</span> of the glory of the grace of God. Our <span class="hi">Afflictions</span> are the <span class="hi">purgings</span> &amp; the <span class="hi">prunings</span> bestow'd by our God <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d31e14530"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=42919&amp;page=64">[Page 117]</a></span> upon us. What are they for? but, <span class="hi">That we may bring forth</span> more <span class="hi">Fruit:</span> and we are told in <span class="hi">Ioh. 15. 8.

Observe it: a <span class="hi">Learning</span> the <span class="hi">Statutes</span> of God, is a <span class="hi">Rendring</span> of <span class="hi">Praises</span> to God; those <span class="hi">two</span> things are <span class="hi">one.</span> Now see what the Psal­mist saith, in Psal 119. 97. <span class="hi">Tis good for me that I have been</span> afflicted, <span class="hi">that I may</span> learn <span class="hi">thy Statutes.</span> This then is incumbent on us under every Affli­ction; Our study should be, <span class="hi">What Advantage, what Engagement to be more holy, is now put into my hands!</span> Every Afflicted man should ask, <span class="hi">How may the</span> Sorrowes <span class="hi">of my</span> life <span class="hi">promote the</span> praises <span class="hi">of my</span> God?</p><div class="application" id="index.xml-body.1_div.4_div.3_div.1"><h3><span class="headingNumber">4.3.1. </span><span class="head">But for the Vse of these things.</span><br/><span class="head">USE.

Such were the Desires of <span class="hi">Paul,</span> in Phil. 1. 22. <span class="hi">I desire to be d<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>ssolved and be with Christ.</span> When we think of the day, in which we shall go to the the <span class="hi">Spirits of just men made perfect;</span> and to <span class="hi">Iesus the Mediator of the New-Covenant;</span> When we <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d31e14654"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=42919&amp;page=65">[Page 118]</a></span> think of the day in which the <span class="hi">Lord will deliver us from the hand of all our enemies, and from the hand of SIN;</span> O the thoughts of it should fill our Souls with Raptures of Joy! they should cause our hearts to leap and spring within us. In is an allowable thing to be almost angry with <span class="hi">Time,</span> to call upon slow <span class="hi">Time,</span> and say, <span class="hi">Fly apaces Fly away, O Time; Come, O</span> Eternity, <span class="hi">come and fetch me into the presence of the Lord.</span> The Visi­ons of the Lord Jesus may cause us to say hum­bly with aged, faithful <span class="hi">Simeon,</span> Lord, <span class="hi">let thy ser­vant</span> depart <span class="hi">in peace.</span> The Chariots of <span class="hi">Death,</span> sent by the Lord Jesus to fetch us unto Himself should be as welcom to us, as the <span class="hi">Waggons</span> of <span class="hi">Io­seph</span> were to <span class="hi">Iacob</span> of old. It should cause us to <span class="hi">Rejoice with joy unspeakable, and full of glory,</span> when we think of the <span class="hi">unspeakable joy</span> and the <span class="hi">full glory</span> which we are going unto. There are holy <span class="hi">long­ings</span> and <span class="hi">lookings</span> of Soul, with which we may cry out, <span class="hi">Why, why are His Churiots so long i'com­ing? Why tarry the Wheels thereof?</span></p><p>But yet,</p><p>Secondly, By way of <span class="hi">Correction.</span></p><p>If these <span class="hi">Desires</span> are <span class="hi">with</span> Impatience, much more if they are <span class="hi">thro'</span> Impatience, they become sinful before the Lord. The embittered spirits of Christians, have been sometimes too prone unto <span class="hi">such</span> Desires. It was an inordinate passion in <span class="hi">Moses,</span> when a froward people under his charge provoked him to say, in <span class="hi">Numb. 17. 14. Kill <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d31e14752"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=42919&amp;page=65">[Page 119]</a></span> me, I pray thee out of hand.</span> Had God granted his Desire, he had lost Thirty years of eminent Service in the World. It was an irregular passion in <span class="hi">Elias,</span> when the persecutions of wic­ked men so tired him, as to make him say, in 1. King. 19. 4. <span class="hi">O Lord, take away my life.</span> It hath been an Observation, that <span class="hi">Many good and, great men sit under</span> Elias's <span class="hi">Iuniper tree.</span> As culpa­ble was the Passion of <span class="hi">Ionah,</span> when the Wither­ing of a Guord had that Effect upon him in Cap. 4. 8. <span class="hi">He wished to</span> dy. The like <span class="hi">pang</span> of Impa­tience, did that <span class="hi">Pattern</span> of Patience, <span class="hi">Iob,</span> fall into be spake as if he could hardly for bear <span class="hi">laying violent hands</span> upon himself. Even so far do the <span class="hi">distempered,</span> unbridled Wishes of many run. Their <span class="hi">Desire</span> of Death is a sort of <span class="hi">Revenge</span> on God; they would as it were deprive God of the glory which He might have of them. Compose these desires, O ye raging Souls; compose these De­sires. Allay this <span class="hi">Fever,</span> this phrensy. Its not on­ly an <span class="hi">irreligious</span> but an <span class="hi">unnatural</span> passion which you are carried away withal. You desire to <span class="hi">dye▪</span> Well, are you sure that the <span class="hi">Death</span> which you <span class="hi">de­sire</span> now, will not prove a <span class="hi">Death</span> which you shall <span class="hi">Deplore</span> throughout eternal Ages. It is said of the Believer in Psal. 91. 19. <span class="hi">With</span> long life <span class="hi">will I</span> satisfie <span class="hi">him, and shew him my Salvation.</span> It is a very disordered heart that will be <span class="hi">dissatisfied</span> with so great a mercy.</p><p>Secondly, <span class="hi">Vnsanctified</span> Desires of Life are to <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d31e14857"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=42919&amp;page=66">[Page 120]</a></span> be Reproved also. Of these Desires there are Three Sorts to be Reprehended.</p><p>There are, first. <span class="hi">Carnal</span> Desires of Life to be blamed. Some desire to <span class="hi">live,</span> and wherefore is it? It is because they desire to <span class="hi">eat</span> and <span class="hi">drink</span> and be merry. They cann't part with such <span class="hi">Relations</span> and <span class="hi">Possessions</span> as are here to be enjoyed. The <span class="hi">Comforts</span> of Life are the things that cause their <span class="hi">Desires</span> of Life. One once beholding his fine Ac­commodations made this Reflection thereupon, <span class="hi">Haec faciunt invitos mori▪,</span> these are the things that make us <span class="hi">unwilling to dy.</span> Unmortified Corrupti­ons are the causes of these desires. Remember what the Lord hath said in Matth. 10. 37. <span class="hi">He that loveth Father or Mother, or Son or</span> DAUGH­TER <span class="hi">more than me, is not worthy of me.</span> Thus may the Lord well say to the <span class="hi">Subject</span> of these De­sires, <span class="hi">If you had rather be with your</span> friends <span class="hi">on</span> earth, <span class="hi">than with your</span> Father <span class="hi">in</span> Heaven, <span class="hi">you are not wor­thy to be with me at all.</span> And this by the way is to be said of them that desire the life of their <span class="hi">Friends</span> as well as of them selves. It is for the Interest of the Lord Jesus Christ that the dead <span class="hi">Children</span> which you lament, <span class="hi">are dead;</span> or else they had not dyed at all. Now sais the Lord Je­sus, <span class="hi">If thou lovest those</span> CHILDREN, <span class="hi">those Re­lations more than me, and hadst rather have them with thy self, to my</span> Prejudice, <span class="hi">than to have them with me, to thy own</span> Bereavement, <span class="hi">thou art not worthy to have them with me at all.</span></p><p><span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d31e14961"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=42919&amp;page=66">[Page 121]</a></span> Secondly. There are <span class="hi">Careful</span> Desires of Life to be likewise blamed. Many desire to <span class="hi">live</span> only upon this account, <span class="hi">Some</span> Child, <span class="hi">or some</span> Charge <span class="hi">they are concerned for.</span> They have this or that <span class="hi">Child</span> which they cannot believe will be well pro­vided for, when they are <span class="hi">dead;</span> or they suspect what will become of such or such a <span class="hi">Charge.</span> There is indeed a Desire of Life on such a Score, which is not alwaies very severely to be found fault withal. But oftentimes there is too much <span class="hi">Distrust</span> in such a <span class="hi">desire.</span> Why cannot we venture our Families and the Concernments thereof, in the Hands of the faithful God? The Lord has said in Jer. 49. 11. <span class="hi">Leave thy fatherless</span> Children, <span class="hi">I will preserve them alive.</span> And he still saies, <span class="hi">I will be a</span> better Father, <span class="hi">and a</span> better Friend <span class="hi">unto them, than thou thy self canst be.</span></p><p>Thirdly. There are <span class="hi">Fearful</span> Desires of Life which are blame-worthy too. When Death comes with that message, <span class="hi">Set thy</span> Soul <span class="hi">in order, for thou shalt dy and not live,</span> many persons are so terrified as to be even at their wits ends. O how they groan. <span class="hi">I cannot dy!</span> Indeed Sinners that have not been <span class="hi">born twice,</span> may well tremble to <span class="hi">dy once;</span> no body can blame <span class="hi">them;</span> there is a <span class="hi">Se­cond Death,</span> ready to sieze upon the forlorn souls that are not Regenerate. But such as have been truly turn'd to God in Christ, should not enter­tain Death with such Reluctancies. Can you not uprightly say, That if you were sure to be <span class="hi">freed</span> <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d31e15046"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=42919&amp;page=67">[Page 122]</a></span> from <span class="hi">Sin,</span> you could be content to be struck by Death? O then, be cheerfully willing to <span class="hi">Dy.</span> Thy soul will no sooner pass into Eternity but it shall experience that thing in <span class="hi">Rom. 6. 7. He that is</span> dead <span class="hi">is</span> freed <span class="hi">from Sin.</span> It is often pretended by men, <span class="hi">I would</span> live <span class="hi">because, I would be more</span> ho­ly <span class="hi">before I dy.</span> Tis well; but there is not seldom a <span class="hi">Deceit</span> in the <span class="hi">Pretence;</span> often something else is in the Bottom; <span class="hi">A Rebellion against the Will of God.</span> Wouldst thou really and earnestly be <span class="hi">ho­ly?</span> Be willing then to <span class="hi">dy</span> as well as to <span class="hi">live.</span> Death is the way to <span class="hi">Holiness</span> in the Perfection of it. In short: Good was the Temper of that sick person who being asked, <span class="hi">Which do you desire, to</span> live, <span class="hi">or to dy?</span> answered, <span class="hi">I refer it to</span> God; and when it was again said, <span class="hi">But suppose God should refer it to you?</span> reply'd, <span class="hi">I would then re­fer it to him again.</span></p></div><div class="application" id="index.xml-body.1_div.4_div.3_div.2"><h3><span class="headingNumber">4.3.2. </span><span class="head">USE.
